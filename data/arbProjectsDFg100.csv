### Problem:
Almost every multi token application in existence requires you to approve your token to a different contract, which can have some serious security implications, and also there's only support sending one token to multiple accounts i.e 1 token -to-N addresses.

### Solution:
AikiSend tackles these problems with the following simple approaches:
1. Routing token approvals and transfers through Uniswap [Permit2 contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2), which is battle tested and audited.
2. Leveraging EIP712 for structured signature of transfer data.
3. Native support for sending multiple tokens say (Dai, UNI, GTC, USDC and so on) all in just  **One Transactoion**, essentially N tokens -to-N addresses üéâ

### Future with Gitcoin grants:
- We plan to revamp the website with modern framework / design system, and  improved UX.
- Add support for other wallet clients/applications.
- Add support for ERC721 and ERC1155 multitoken standards.

Pairwise is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, like a dating app, allowing users to choose between pairs of options to signal their preferences as opposed to having to read endless forum posts and vote within a set time period. The system converts these simple subjective inputs into objective, measurable outputs, minimizing the cost and cognitive burden of voting.

## How does it work?

Pairwise started as a seed of an idea from the [big brain algorithm research out of Colony back in 2018](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/). Pairwise is a decentralized voting dapp that aims to make it easier for Web3 communities to signal their preferences and make informed decisions. Pairwise is implemented as a website with its own front end and an open-source backend. Pairwise voting will be compatible with all EVM chains and development is fully open source.

One of the biggest problems in DAOs is lack of engagement in governance processes. The goal of the project is to improve the decision-making process by providing a valuable alternative to traditional voting systems and promoting community engagement in the decision-making process. We are confident that this project has the potential to make a significant impact as a public good and we look forward to the opportunity to bring Pairwise voting to life with your support.

## How does it support Public Goods?

The mission of Pairwise is to be a public good itself (by being free & open source), and by supporting decision making within public good DAOs and projects. It is non-excludable (anyone can use it for free) and non rivalrous (it can work alongside any other governance tool).

![|602x320](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DxDwtj3rHx-EsC87ETeVk4IrNgChTBAN5K9FIhDPwYNVVk7u8uel8DeHsx96Xp967Cbex8wsvEF0IUCpFoJyalVvw8VzHTtfJK8YskSfIovrN1JrrX9PFENXq8in7Tmj5AVwXaF-aSAGJqaX8q1gbyY)Here are a few practical use case studies and specific examples of how Pairwise could benefit public goods in the web3 space:

**Grant Proposals:** Pairwise comparison helps organizations prioritize grant proposals by systematically comparing their potential impact and feasibility, ensuring more effective funding distribution. This is especially useful in cases where there are many projects or initiatives that are requesting funding (retroactive public goods, Gitcoin grants etc.).

**Decentralized Curation and Ranking:** Pairwise can be used to compare, rank and curate projects, content, products, or services, and can serve as a ‚Äúdecentralized suggestion algorithm‚Äù. One use case being explored is with Giveth, where users can vote on projects that they are passionate about, which would then feed into the website ranking. This not only allows the community to vote on what projects are important for them, but it also opens the door for new projects to surface that otherwise would have not received the same exposure.

**User research:** A fun use case is user research, where the community can be polled on what their subjective preferences are. For example, this can be used within any DAO to decide on features as kind of a ‚Äúhot or not‚Äù game, where users can vote on specific designs or traits, to determine which ones are most valued by the community.

**Progress**

**Video Demo**

We have a working demo and are doing our initial user testing with the Giveth Community.

**Differentiation (from other projects)**

Pairwise is similar to Snapshot, but with a specific type of UX. Snapshot votes are built around the expectation that users will go do research in forums and read long-form discussions. Our approach leans into the fact that most of the community isn‚Äôt even going to skim the forum posts and will vote with their gut. The goal is to give a clearer signal of what the community wants through more engagement in fun and simple micro-decisions.

Pairwise shouldn‚Äôt be used for EVERY decision, but we believe it is an important complement to the current voting applications that exist today.

At General Magic, we believe in the power of collaboration in the open-source world. That's why we would be thrilled if Snapshot chose to integrate Pairwise into their platform. However, even if Snapshot decides not to, we are still committed to deploying this feature independently and integrating Snapshot's strategies into our system. We believe that this will benefit the entire governance ecosystem as we work together to create more efficient methods based on algorithms.

Multichain Integration: Givestation is built on a multichain infrastructure, currently deployed on 5 chains allowing users to participate and contribute using various blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, zk synce and Optimism. This interoperability broadens the reach of the platform and makes it accessible to a wider audience.

Rewards for Contributors: Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms where contributors often receive only the product or service they funded, Givestation rewards contributors with a BuidlPoints and other tokens for funding projects. This incentivizes users to actively engage in public goods, fostering a vibrant and supportive community.

Web3 Integration: Givestation fully embraces the Web3 ecosystem, providing users with a seamless and decentralized experience. Users have control over their funds, access to transparent smart contract interactions, and the ability to track their contributions on the blockchain.

History of the Project:
Givestation was conceived in late 2020 in response to the growing demand for decentralized crowdfunding solutions within the Web3 space. The project was initiated by a team of blockchain enthusiasts and developers who recognized the need for a platform that combined the benefits of blockchain technology, crowdfunding, and community engagement. Getting grants from some grant programs, since its inception, Givestation has undergone rigorous development, testing, and refinement to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience.

What's Next for Givestation:
The future of Givestation holds exciting developments and expansion plans. Some potential directions for the project may include:

Cross-Chain Compatibility: Expanding support for additional blockchain networks to provide users with even more choices and flexibility when participating in crowdfunding projects.

Governance Mechanisms: Implementing decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing token holders to have a say in platform decisions, such as project approvals and protocol upgrades.

Community Growth: Continuing to build a strong and engaged user community by fostering partnerships, hosting events, and incentivizing contributions.

Token Utility:
The native token of Givestation (GVST) serves multiple purposes within the ecosystem:

Staking: Token holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards, providing an additional incentive to participate in the platform.

Campaign Contributions: Users can use the token to fund projects and campaigns on the platform.

Governance: Token holders may have voting rights to influence platform decisions and proposals.

Rewards: Users receive tokens as rewards for contributing to campaigns, which can be traded on various exchanges or held for potential future gains.",https://givestation.org,bafkreieqlbdzcodzmlyj6hr6rnjvipazmrvtqx6c6hwshndihql44dyizy,bafkreieodx3y7tfuhrkjxnz65oysdsiquam2iewlwbjgwzos5bdxq7cwmy,NA,Givestation,givestation,bafkreiddqzyk2tqgwyedrs43wzzlibcupc3tdlx4mjnvlf5cln5yey5vjq

Why we are different:
The ASOCKS token has a limited supply of 5,000 and will be distributed in a way that gives everyone a chance to own a unique piece of the tokenized asset. The lion‚Äôs share of the tokens won‚Äôt go to friends, developers, venture capital firms, advisors, partners, or any other groups who can dump the tokens in the future.

The $ASOCKS token and NFT will have a fixed supply of 5,000 and each unit will be backed by a physical sock. ArbiSocks work similarly to unisocks, with the cost per pair of socks varying according to the liquidity pool. To claim the physical pair, you need to burn a minimum of 1 out of 5,000 $ASOCKS tokens, which decreases the overall supply and elevates the scarcity (and thus, the worth) of the remaining socks.


Future Goal
Customizable: Our aim is to offer customization options that empower users to personalize their design using our unique features.

The Punk Domains protocol is **not a fork** of ENS or any other protocol, but is a **completely unique protocol** with its own **novel codebase**. 

All the code is **open-source** and accessible via GitHub.

What sets Punk Domains apart from other protocols like ENS or UD is its ability to issue an **unlimited number of domain extensions** (e.g., .smol, .arbi, .ppl, etc.). The architecture is **highly modular** and allows for **various domain types** and business models, such as **one-time purchase** domains, **soulbound** domains, **renewable** domains, etc.

The purpose of the protocol is to **provide domain extensions to DAOs** and other web3 communities and projects, serving as a ""white-label"" solution. This is what **differentiates** Punk Domains from other web3 domain protocols.

For example, the **Smol Brains NFT** community has the **.smol domain** extension issued through the Punk Domains protocol. Each community member can mint their own .smol name via a dedicated frontend (https://www.smol.domains/).

These .smol names are **integrated and used in various dApps**, such as the **Treasure DAO** web app (https://app.treasure.lol/), **Battlefly** web3 game (https://www.battlefly.game/), **Smolove.xyz** dApp, Send2.name wallet, etc.

To easily integrate and use punk domains, we are also developing Iggy, a **web3 social template** where punk domains are used as usernames and profiles. This template makes it easy for web3 communities to set up **decentralized chats** for their communities.

It has a bold goal: to make real estate more accessible, fair, and efficient for everyone.

In the current real estate world, there are many problems that affect both regular people and businesses. These problems include difficulties in getting loans, high interest rates, and investment opportunities that only a few privileged individuals can access. Aqaro sees these issues and wants to provide new solutions to fix them.

One of Aqaro's main goals is to get rid of the need for traditional banks and financial institutions when dealing with real estate. Instead, it wants to give more power to individuals to control their finances. This shift towards decentralization could make the housing market more open and fair.

Aqaro has developed some key features to put these solutions into action. The DeFi Mortgage Protocol, for example, lets people buy homes directly through the platform and allows investors to earn money by investing in Ethereum (ETH). The Fractionalization of Real Estate is another feature, which allows multiple investors to own parts of business properties using a technology called NFTs.

Aqaro also has a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where community members can make important decisions about the platform's future. They get rewarded for their active involvement. The platform also makes it easier for people to buy and sell properties with features like Listings Properties and the Escrow Service.

What's unique about Aqaro is its revenue-sharing model. A whopping 45% of the revenue generated by the platform flows back to investors and DAO participants. This means that as the platform succeeds, those who are part of the Aqaro ecosystem will benefit directly. It's a way to make sure that the community that helps Aqaro grow also shares in its success.

In short, Aqaro's mission is to give more power to individuals, make housing fairer, and let the community play a big role in how things work in the real estate world. They're taking on the challenges faced by the current market and offering creative solutions that could change how we think about real estate.",https://aqaro.app,bafkreidomkjyscsn6lrzgb7gxbsntqbdyy4gqrt57c7yffzklgqwoosuee,NA,JordyKingz,aqaro-decentralized-real-estate,aqaroOfficial,bafkreibs4xzrwvepumrmsgeq4jr34hyy2ejyefbuginvbbddavyhrie2xa

### Project description
We are building tools that enable NFT communities on Arbitrum to acquire ENS sub-domains at zero cost. This is accomplished via utilizing an ENS feature called wildcard resolution. Our suite of tools allows anyone with an ENS name to link it to a collection and provide the NFT holders with free subdomains that are immediately compatible with popular wallets e.g Metamask & Trust wallet. Developers will also be able to utilize our open-source tools to build collection-specific ENS integrations. [ENSIP 10 - ENSIP-10: Wildcard Resolution - ENS Documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution)


### Problem Statement
NFT projects & communities on Arbitrum have expressed a desire to use ENS names and subdomains to identify and connect with their users and holders. However, the cost of setting a distinct record on the ENS Registry for each subdomain can be prohibitively expensive for communities with large user bases. This creates unnecessary friction for NFT holders, who often stand to benefit greatly from the usability improvements offered by ENS names.

### Value Proposition
Wildcards Protocol offers a solution to this problem by allowing every NFT holder in a specified collection (e.g Arbibabes) to receive an ENS name at no cost & without registration. The process for the ENS domain holder is simple: just link their domain name to the NFT collection they want to support. From there, digit subdomains (such as 69.arbibabes.eth) will automatically point to and resolve to the current owner of the NFT in the chosen collection (for example, Babe #69)

### Benefit to the Arbitrum Ecosystem
The possibility of acquiring free ENS domains will drive users to explore Arbitrum and Arbitrum NFTs.
Communities on Arbitrum will be able to unite under a single namespace with built-in utility, helping to create a more cohesive and connected ecosystem.",https://wildcards.wtf/,bafkreibd2akygvwvmq7ffgi6oslnbv2wvhsbbk5sjplogqo4rjuani6vse,bafkreic6q3aazo7tf6ye3ez3lgxurdb46q25ci2yhi7h4iznkuiat4lg7m,Davidvete,Wildcards-Protocol,wildcardswtf,bafkreifmxwokumqhskfnbjehigsm5326xv3psv5n3helh6xs7ch2d4vdzm

![Thunder Chat App](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/644a1d20276639b1bf2ddf93_ThunderChat_Header.png)

##### Introduction
Thunder is a blockchain project that aims to provide a secure messaging platform for users. With the rise of web3 technologies, users are more aware of the importance of privacy and security. Thunder leverages the ERC-4337 technology so we can onboard the mass adoption of users. Users do not need to go through the hassle of securing seed phrases to interact with the blockchain. Social recovery of accounts is possible and gasless transactions can be achieved via third parties.

##### Problem Statement
The current messaging platforms in the market, such as Telegram and WhatsApp, have been criticised for their lack of privacy and security. These platforms collect user data and use it for targeted advertising or share it with third-party companies. This puts the privacy of users at risk and raises concerns about data breaches and cyber attacks.

##### Solution
Thunder solves this problem by encrypting messages before storing them on the blockchain. The contents stored on the blockchain is immutable and only the intended parties are given access to this encrypted information. Thunder does not collect any user data and does not share it with third-party companies. This provides users with complete control over their data and ensures that their privacy is protected. Mass adoption of this chat application is further cemented by the ease of account creation via ERC-4337 technology.

![Chat App Screen 1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/644a1d18858d286913c6122a_ThunderChat_1.png)

##### Features

Thunder offers the following features:

###### Seamless account creation
Thunder uses ERC-4337 technology to create an account seamlessly for end users. Users do not need to go through the hassle of understanding and securing seed phrases to interact with the blockchain. The smooth chatting experience makes it such that users do not even know they are interacting via the blockchain.

###### Secure messaging
Thunder uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol combined with an AES-256 GCM encryption scheme to provide end-to-end data encryption. All messages are secure and private. This means that only the sender and the recipient can read the messages, and no one else, not even Thunder, can access them.

The following diagram shows the process flow of Thunder:
![Process Flow 1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/64d6c7773365e9c659de89be_01_ER_Diagram_Thunder_Chat_User_Profile.png)

###### Decentralized storage
Thunder stores user data on the blockchain, ensuring that it is immutable and cannot be tampered with. This means that user data is not stored on centralized servers, which are vulnerable to attacks and data breaches. Instead, user data is stored on a decentralized network of nodes, which ensures that it is available at all times and cannot be lost.

###### User privacy
Thunder does not collect any user data and does not share it with third-party companies, ensuring that user privacy is protected. This means that users have complete control over their data and can choose what they want to share with other parties.

###### Gas-less payment
Chat contents are written on the blockchain without consumers needing to pay a single dollar. A paymaster concept is introduced in our application to facilitate seamless interaction between users.

###### Open-source
Thunder is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and review its code. This ensures that Thunder is transparent and accountable to its users, and that its code is auditable and secure.

![Chat App Screen 3](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/644a1d1de370efa38f95bb48_ThunderChat_3.png)

##### Driving user adoption
We are working on a Chat API to allow all Arbitrum games and projects to integrate chat function with minimal effort.

##### Obstacles and Challenges
Gas fees are currently the biggest challenge for our project. We are currently exploring to launch our own Orbit AnyTrust chain or collaborate with existing Orbit chains.

##### Conclusion
With Thunder, users can communicate with each other securely and privately without worrying about their data being collected or shared with third-party companies. Our mission is to make Thunder the first blockchain killer app that successfully appeals to the masses, onboarding the next billion users onto web3.


##### Status Update
As of Aug 2023, our MVP has been built and we are currently carrying out internal testing before we upload it to Google Playstore and Apple Store for public beta testing.

As of Sep 2023, our MVP can be downloaded from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thunder.chat

AikiCloud is a web3 platform that allows anyone to rent cloud infrastructure using ERC4907 NFT rentals.
Think of it like the Opensea for cloud infrastructure rentals or lease.  

### The Problemüòî  
Up until now, there's  no web3 native way to get access to cloud services and infrastructure, without setting up traditional web2 payment gateways and solutions. 
In a web3 native world, we believe getting access to cloud services should be as easy as sending a simple transaction on-chain, and that's the primary motivation for AikiCloud.

AikiCloud would essentially offer a range of cloud services from simple to more sophisticated services, backed by major cloud providers like GCP and AWS, but not limited to those two. We are essentially allowing anyone ideally, with a web3 wallet to be able to access the platform and use infrastructure in the cloud all from their web3 wallet.


### How the web3 and Arbitrum community can benefit üöÄ  

1. A developer: AikiCloud can give Arbitrum/web3 developers and enthusiast more flexibility in how they access and use cloud resources. For example, anyone can use AikiCloud to rent cloud resources on a per-use basis, all from a web3 native wallet like metamask.

2.  An NFT project: NFT art projects, often have the need  to use infrastructure like stable diffusion servers and the likes, for image art generation, now it's possible to provision on from your wallet on the fly.

3. Web3 native user: We believe web3 users could have various needs for cloud services, for productive, educational or other purposes we haven't yet anticipate for,  however as the need arises we can expand on our services and provision for their use case.


### Conclusion üöÄ
AikiCloud is a promising project that has the potential to provide a number of benefits to the Arbitrum and broader web3 community. By reducing the friction to access cloud services, increasing flexibility, and improving scalability, AikiCloud can help Arbitrum developers to build and deploy better applications.

![Zengo protocol](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/998618862255870056/1153497234042798180/Zengo1.png?width=1150&height=647)


Zengo's mission is to improve the efficiency of urban processes, promote transparency, and establish a decentralized funding mechanism for cities in Mexico and Latin America. We designed zengo for two key roles - citizens and moderators - who work together across four stages of each governance cycle: registering, verifying, funding, and monitoring urban issues that the public budget cannot solve.

During registration, citizens and moderators can first participate in live or virtual onboarding events to attest their digital skills in multiple networks and get proof of assistance that enables them to interact without paying any gas fees, taking leverage of the account abstraction and cross-chain infrastructure. After the onboarding events, participants can propose governance ideas or register as moderators. There are four types of moderators: Civil Organization, Private Sector, Academy, and Government. Additionally, an open moderator position is available.

The verifying stage is an iterative process where moderators review the proposals to vote on whether they are valid or how the public budget can manage them. In this stage, moderators can request the proposer to provide evidence of municipal, state, or federal requests to solve the issue. The process repeats until the proposal moderators vote that any government level has solved the proposal or if they vote to pass it to plural voting in case the public budget cannot solve the issue.

In the plural voting stage, the zengo contract distributes 25 points to each moderator to vote quadratically among the proposals. The plural voting mechanism prevents the concentration of votes on a few participants and balances the distribution of resources. During this stage, the contract distributes incentives to moderators and proposers according to the merit recorded in the zengo platform during verification.

Finally, citizens must provide evidence of using the allocated funds during the following stage. At the same time, moderators verify its veracity and reach a consensus on the proposal outcome, allowing the proposer participation in future governance cycles or restricting this stage until the citizen presents the results.

2. roadmap: https://all-weather.gitbook.io/all-weather-protocol/overview/roadmap

All Weather Protocol is dedicated for DeFi users who want to diversify their portfolio.

Following Warren Buffett's advice, it's wise for average people to consider ETFs or index funds for diversification. However, ETF in traditional finance usually cost higher fee; and in the Web3 space has limited options for such ETFs or index funds products.

Here's how the All Weather Portfolio outperforms other products:

1. Traditional ETF vs. All Weather Protocol:
    1. ETFs in the US market, for instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, are some of the most popular ETFs in the states. However, they only provide around a 12.78% APR and distribute dividends to their shareholders on a 3-month cadence.
    2. All Weather: Providing a 19.63% APR at the time of writing and distributes dividends with every block, which occurs every 0.26 seconds.

2. Web3 Index Fund vs. All Weather Protocol:
    1. Web3 Index Fund: Unlike Index Coop and Set Protocol, which only hold assets without incurring any impermanent loss, they also miss out on staking or farming rewards.
    2. All Weather: Taking diversification a step further by integrating other defi protocols like SushiSwap, Pendle, Equilibria and Radiant Protocol. With an All-Weather portfolio, you not only enjoy token growth but also farming rewards. If you're like us and not good at timing when to sell, then AMMs won't cause you any impermanent loss; on the contrary, they'll help you with dollar-cost averaging.

Forus is a cutting-edge privacy solution that empowers users to receive funds while safeguarding their personal wallet address from prying eyes. With Forus, users consistently obtain funds through a fresh stealth address, preserving the utmost privacy in financial transactions Forus creates a fortified and confidential space, granting users the ability to receive funds discreetly through a quick , cheap and user-friendly interface.

## Description ##

When using Forus, you no longer have to be confined to a single wallet address. The issue with sticking to one address is that it can attract prying eyes. For instance, everyone knows that 'vitalik.eth' belongs to Vitalik Buterin. This opens the door to tracking his transaction history and potentially gaining insights into his financial activities. This situation might not sit well with some individuals, right?

Here at Forus, you can bid farewell to the need for a personal wallet address. When you enter forus,  simple generate  a forus key (which is a cryptographic hash not related to any real blockchain address) make sure to securely store your forus key's private Key name as ""signature key"".  Once you have your Forus key, share it with the sender. The sender will then craft a new address for you by doing some fancy math with your forus key , one that neither you nor the sender could predict. From then you dont need to send him any real wallet address he got your forus key when u would transfer you funds a new stealth address would be created on demand which you can control only.


## How it  Works ##

1. The receiver generates a new ""ForusKey,"" which is a one-time, base58 encoded address . Instead of sharing the personal wallet address, the receiver provides the Forus Key to receive funds.(Note : ForusKey is not bound to any blockchain address)

2. The receiver also generates a corresponding ""signature Key"" on demand, which serves as the private key for the Forus Key. This signature should securely saved for future use. (Note :Never share your signature Key with anyone always share ForusKey to receive funds)

3. Next the sender generates a stealth address by doing some fancy math stuff with the receiver's Forus Key and sends funds to this new address. Also sender generates a public key on demand, and publishes it in a designated logs directory. This entire process is completed in a single transaction.

4. The receiver periodically scans the logs directory and perform calculations using his signature Key and the sender's public key. Through Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the receiver derives the private key for the stealth address on which the funds have been sent.

5. With the derived private key, the receiver gains control over that address on which the funds have been sent and can manage the funds received securely.

In summary Forus uses cryptographic algorithms and one-time-use keys that allow users to receive funds through addresses which are created by sender but controlled by receiver.



## Why do u need Forus ? ##

When people start poking into your transactions, they can act like detectives and piece together who you are and what you're doing. It's definitely not cool, right? It's like someone snooping around in your personal diary. But that's where Forus comes in, making sure that your financial stuff remains private





## What next for Forus ? Milestones  ##

Forus is still under development .There are important things we need to work on before it's fully functional and user-friendly. Here's what we have planned.

**1.Making it more User-Friendly**: We want to make sure using Forus is easy and intuitive. We'll improve the design, simplify processes, and make it more user-friendly.

**2.Adding NFTs**: Forus is now limited to coins and tokens only, but we have plans in integrating anonymous nfts transfers too , would expand its capabilities and attract a broader user base.

**3.Testing and Auditing**: We'll conduct thorough testing and audits to find and fix any issues. This is important to make sure Forus is reliable, secure, and stable.

**4.Deploying on the Mainnet and on other evm compatible blockchains** : We would make Forus accessible and compatible with all main blockchain networks .

**5.Relayer feature**: The relayer feature would be added to securely withdraw the funds to the user's personal address without giving the gas fee in native currency . Well forus also supports erc20 tokens but its not possible to pay in tokens.

**6.Adding Cool Features** : We'll keep adding new features based on what our users want. This could mean more privacy options, support for different tokens, or integration with other cool apps.

**7.Cross-Chain Compatibility**: As interoperability becomes more prominent, Forus could explore enabling cross-chain transactions. This would allow users to maintain their privacy while transacting between different networks.

Our main goal with Forus is to make it easy to use while keeping your transactions private and secure. By working on these areas and making the necessary improvements, we hope Forus will become a trusted and widely used solution for private and secure transactions.",https://forus.live,bafkreicxkcxejk54qrnhuqqbdk74535f2g7wng2lyl5bo4rlwaqlulelte,bafkreih5ym5yhgzaga57o7e6s3vxc56fg3iegnzmlkxx76n6hefjpcha3q,oxMaaz,TheForus,the_forus,bafkreiekjrpsyk3clfdjcjvmpvsi2kmuyx5ol7drliziur42fq7adrp2tq

üîÜ What is BrightID?
BrightID is building an identity lego that allows users to prove to applications that they only exist once in any given system.

What if you could always prove you were a real unique user?
It‚Äôs easy in the real world to ensure you‚Äôre dealing with a unique or a specific person, but imagine how many systems could be improved or made possible if every user or account could prove they only exist once as we transition to the digital era?

* Digital voting and governance - including quadratic voting, liquid democracy, and signaling
* Truly universal income or airdrop distributions payable to literally everyone
* Public-goods funding allocation - trust minimized and collusion resistant thanks to MACI
* Social media without millions of bots polluting the discourse
* Credit systems for under-collateralized DeFi
* And so much more...

üîÜ How does it work?
BrightID is creating a giant pseudonymous social graph of people all around the world. Users can make private, cryptographically secure connections to people they know, using a smartphone app. This pseudonymous connection data is shared among a decentralized group of computer nodes that store and analyze the public social graph. The nodes of the network determine and verify the likely uniqueness of each account, based on its interconnectivity with other accounts. The user can then use their BrightID verification to prove to any integrated system that they have one and only one account. The potential integrations are endless.

üîÜ Where will my contributions go?
BrightID Main DAO is a LAO (a DAO with a legal wrapper) that stewards centralized pieces until they can be decentralized, such as the app registry, website, and app store entries. It also has stewardship over grant and sponsorship income, and functions as a non-profit. It has been committed to BrightID‚Äôs core mission and funded the core team since its inception in Feb 2020.
100% of contributed funds will go to BMAIN DAO.

Problem Statement

In the current status, blockchain protocols and applications are too costly to build and maintain. Moreover, it's difficult to fully understand the technical demands and design structures that can adapt to changing needs of decentralized applications, let alone addressing real-world gaps with novel web3 use cases. This is because many smart contracts are built in monolithic contracts that lack composability, which makes it much more costly and time-consuming to build new smart contracts or change the existing ones. Many projects that try to realize a product market through multiple iterations are burdened by these recurrently aggravating expenses, in some cases leading to the failure of the project. 

While wealthy projects have the means to create, update, and audit complex smart contracts, not every project enjoys such financial luxury. The blockchain ecosystem needs a communication protocol that simplifies the creation of blockchain apps and allows for continuous innovation without pouring massive resources into smart contract development. Without this, scaling the transformative powers of blockchain to real-world adaption and novel use cases is extremely challenging.

Project Overview
In today's world, 152 out of 195 countries are regarded as developing countries, where in many of them, the average monthly salary is less than $500. 
https://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php

With a vision to lower entry barriers, Inverter Protocol aims to democratize building on blockchain by addressing the longstanding challenges in blockchain application development, namely high costs, intricate technical demands, and the rigid, non-composable design seen in many monolithic smart contracts. 


Inverter addresses these challenges with a modular framework designed for on-chain operating systems. Its design allows for configuring and operating protocols as smart contract workflows, ensuring they are both upgradable and extendable. To achieve this, we break down smart contract functionalities into compatible modules. This method allows for individualized adjustments, fine-tuning smart contract capabilities to serve unique needs while maintaining overall coherence. Think of these modules as specialized tools: developers can use these building blocks to craft personalized smart contract workflows and set the groundwork for a wide range of use cases. 

While Inverter is designed for broad compatibility across multiple chains, its core values and features are especially synergistic with Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum. This alignment prioritizes enhanced scalability and reduced on-chain burden, making it particularly advantageous for builders on Arbitrum.

Core Offerings

Inverter Open Library of Modules: 
This is a robust collection of reusable, upgradable, and audited standalone smart contracts. These modules are designed with broad blockchain compatibility in mind and can be customized and composed into protocols and mechanisms to serve their unique needs. When integrated with platforms like Arbitrum, our architecture can further expedite protocol and application development and collaboration across the Arbitrum ecosystem. 

Orchestrator Contract: 
Our core operator contracts act as an interoperability layer that connects Inverter modules, ensuring seamless asset flows, permissions, and logic functionalities. Its unique design offers users a low-code interface to configure and dynamically operate smart contracts. 

With Inverter‚Äôs architecture, projects on Arbitrum can immediately adapt and modify functionalities without additional development and auditing costs.


Startup toolkit SDKs: 
The Inverter Protocol introduces a sophisticated suite of workflow templates that can function as SDKs, catering specifically to startups and emergent enterprises in search of robust, cost-efficient blockchain solutions. Each component within Inverter's offering undergoes rigorous auditing, ensuring security and efficacy right out of the box. 

Furthermore, we are designing our intuitive drag-and-drop interface to democratize the creation process. This means that even individuals with nascent blockchain expertise will be able to conceptualize, design, and implement intricate workflows, thus accelerating the pathway from ideation to real-world application.


Vision 

Our long-term vision is to establish Inverter as a standard in blockchain protocols, offering a durable framework that allows organizations to easily set up and manage smart contracts tailored for their needs. Our Open Library of Modules, maintained by the community, will serve as the foundation for our interoperable solutions. To realize this vision, we're developing the Inverter Control Room, an interactive low-code interface, where users can effortlessly select, simulate, and deploy modules to design workflows. When paired with Arbitrum's cost-effective ecosystem, it presents a unique opportunity for developers previously deterred by the steep costs of blockchain development. Additionally, as projects adopt Inverter‚Äîwhether on Arbitrum or not‚Äîtheir additions to the Open Library of Modules enrich the entire community. This creates a cohesive ecosystem where developers benefit from each other‚Äôs innovation and thrive together.

Toaster Finance is a DeFi All-In-One service that makes it fast and easy to access and invest in multiple DeFi protocols. It substantially enhances the UX of DeFi investing by abstracting the necessary transactions involved, Swap, Bridge, and LP providing on a single page. It improves both the time cost of exploring pools or tokens to invest in and the monetary cost of fees and slippage. After staking LPs, users can manage their assets on Toaster Finance at once through withdrawal, rebalance, and collection fees.

Toaster Finance makes it easy for users to access cutting-edge DeFi protocols without having to learn how to use them. With Toaster Finance, users can save time and money participating in DeFi and enjoy investing quickly and easily. Investors can diversify their strategies with Toaster by moving their holdings around without restrictions, and there are endless strategies users can use to invest, so they can use Toaster in their own style.



2. Major Features

As stated in the Project Description, Toaster Finance is a DeFi All-In-One service that makes it easy and fast to access multiple DeFi protocols by solving Swap, Bridge, and Stake LPs on a single page. To create an ecosystem that makes DeFi easier and faster for everyone to enjoy, Toaster Finance is building the following features: Invest, Exchange, Manage Portfolio, Bot, Lending, and RWA. Invset, Exchange, and Portfolio already have the basics implemented and are ready to be extended with additional chains and protocols. Bots and Lending are currently in development.

Before introducing the features, let's talk about the protocols and chains we support. We currently support five protocols: Uniswap V3, Pancakeswap V3, Curve Finance, Lido, and Stargate. We also support six chains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. The number of supported protocols and chains will be expanded as the market reacts and Toaster Finance's standards evolve, but we are committed to ensuring that all protocols and chains that are meaningful to our users are available on Toaster Finance.

The more accessible DeFi becomes to investors, the more impactful the existing players become. This is analogous to how a country's center becomes more active when it develops transportation between the center and periphery for balanced regional development. It's the same with Layer2 chains: fast, reliable, and simple chains will attract more people and accelerate progress. Toaster Finance will serve as a vehicle to increase the overall market pie, and in doing so, the DeFi market, Arbitrum, and Toaster Finance will grow together.

* Invsest 
Toaster Finance aggregates the pools that exist on supported protocols and chains in one place. Users can sort the pools according to their preferred criteria, such as APR and TVL, and select the desired investment. Once a user has selected a pool, we help them convert their assets into a form that can be deposited into that pool, all on one page. Users can finalize their swap, bridge, and stake LP on one page, saving both time and money. Currently supporting V3's investment methodology, users can set a price range when investing in a pool and be informed of the resulting APR. Once invested, they can see if their position is within the price range, and even rebalance if it's out of range. Currently, Toaster Finance supports 162 pools.

* Exchange 
Toaster Finance makes the process of exchanging tokens on a DEX very simple. It supports multiple swap and bridge services on a single page, allowing you to exchange any asset you own into tokens on any chain.‚Ä®When you manage your assets through your personal wallet, you can truly say you own them. The desire to participate in the blockchain ecosystem and leverage your holdings is realized through DeFi, and the most basic starting point for this is to exchange your tokens for the form you want. The ability to exchange is also essential when looking for tokens that are not available for purchase on CEXs. Toaster Finance addresses this pain point and makes it easier for more people to manage and move their wealth. Many tokens make it a point to be swappable on UniSwap when they first list on a DEX, especially when tokens like PEPE and DOGE become popular, users flock to DEXs to buy them. At this point, Toaster Finance gives users a way to buy the tokens they want, no matter what assets they have, when they want to buy them. Currently, Toaster Finance offers a total of 150 exchange directions across the chains it supports.

* Manage Portfolio 
Portfolio feature allows users to see at a glance the assets they own across multiple chains. This allows you to instantly see if your transactions have been completed properly after completing an Invest or Exchange process, as well as manage withdrawals, rebalancing, and collecting fee for your positions if you have staked LPs.‚Ä®When you invest in DeFi, you're managing assets across multiple chains and tokens. The ability to aggregate and display your scattered assets and manage your positions is a huge time saver. The rebalance feature in particular maximizes this advantage. We shows green and red circles to indicate whether a position is in or out of the normal range, so users can intuitively understand the status of their positions, and if they want to re-deposit into the normal range, they can easily manage their positions by pressing the Rebalance button.

* Bot‚Ä®
Toaster Finance supports bot services to help users invest quickly and easily. We plan to support a number of features to help with investing.‚Ä®For example, despite the existence of the Rebalance feature in My Portfolio, it is inconvenient for users to constantly check if their positions are in the right range after adding liquidity. The Toaster Finance Bot will send out alerts at a frequency of the user's choosing to let them know if their positions are well within the price range. This allows users to be informed about their positions via Telegram and easily manage their positions on Toaster Finance by pressing Rebalance if they are out of range.

3. Conclusion

We aim to provide a personalized investment environment without limits and without deep knowledge of DeFi. To this end, in addition to the major features mentioned above, we will support features such as investment recommendations, account abstraction, automatic rebalancing bots, and position backtesting in the future. We applied to ArbitrumDAOGrants because we believe that Arbitrum is a fast and stable chain that can maximize users' DeFi UX experience.

Unitap = Universal Tap (Faucet)

Introduction:

Getting started in crypto and web3 is hard, confusing, and costly for new users. Unitap is here to help. We are building a platform for learning the basics by doing, and distributing project, DAO and gas tokens to onboard the world to web3.

If you have a friend and you want them to learn crypto, send them to https://unitap.app.

How it works:

Unitap provides a series of Taps that remove obstacles for new web3 users in their onboarding path, including:

Gas Tap

To start learning web3, you need a tiny amount of gas, but it‚Äôs often frustrating to get it. Gas Tap solves this.

More than 4,000 users have already claimed over 100,000 drips of gas tokens on 28 different networks, including test networks.

Token Tap 

Claim project and DAO tokens. Token tap allows projects and DAOs to easily democratize governance. Because Unitap claimers are limited in how many types of project or DAO tokens they can claim, they‚Äôre more likely to be interested in holding and using the tokens.

Token tap currently distributes Bitcoin, $SONG, and $BRIGHT. We are going to add many more‚Äìplease contact us if there‚Äôs a token you‚Äôd like to see distributed on Token Tap!

In development:

Prize Tap - Enter to win raffles for larger prizes. Sometimes it‚Äôs more impactful to give more tokens to fewer recipients. We are partnering with ChainLink to provide open and auditable raffles.

Learn Tap - Learn about web3 by using it. Learn Tap guides new users to make their very first steps into web3 including wallet creation, obtaining gas, and doing their first on-chain transactions.

Funder Dashboard - We‚Äôre creating a dashboard to make it easy to create your own distribution on Token tap or Prize tap.  You can set the duration, amount per person, one-time or recurring, and gating (such as BrightID).

Benefits:

Reduced costs: Unitap allows users to claim gas tokens and other digital assets for free, making it affordable to get started with web3.

Easy access: Our Taps provide a simple and intuitive way for users to obtain digital assets, without the need for technical expertise or specialized knowledge.

Sybil resistance: Most faucets are abused by bad actors, sybils and bots. We use BrightID to prevent malicious actors and bots from abusing our faucets, ensuring that each real human can claim their fair share of digital assets. As technology advances (for example, with BrightID‚Äôs new Aura verification method), Unitap will adopt the best anti-sybil solutions.

Claim limits:

For all taps, we limit claims to 5 per user (for example) out of potentially thousands of token choices. This forces claimers to pick the tokens they value most. It provides important feedback and curation‚Äìwith the most valuable and useful tokens rising to the top.

## What is CrossDAO?

CrossDAO is an innovative service provider designed to allow Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from different blockchains to jointly vote on proposals and post proof of voting attestations to any DAO forum such as Optimism Governance and ENS DAO forum. This cross-chain collaboration has been a major challenge in the blockchain space, and CrossDAO leverages advanced technology to overcome it.

In a typical scenario, suppose there are three DAOs from different blockchains who want to jointly vote on a proposal proposed by a different DAO, Axelar DAO. The proposal could involve the transfer of tokens from the base chain to the Optimism chain. Traditionally, this would be impossible due to interoperability constraints between different blockchains. CrossDAO solves this problem by enabling DAOs to vote, attest their vote, and bridge the attestation from their source chain to any chain where the proposal is live.

The process involves each DAO registering a domain name with Axelar on their respective main chains. Then, Axelar DAO deploys a proposal executable smart contract, which triggers the proposed action once all conditions have been met. The participating DAOs can attest their votes on their respective chains, and the attestations are then bridged to the chain where the proposal was originally made. Once all the DAOs have attested their votes, the proposal can be executed. The proof of proposal attestation can be posted on any governance forum for transparency and accountability.

CrossDAO's solution has eliminated the need for intermediaries and made the voting process more efficient and corruption-free. It brings a new level of interoperability to the blockchain world, enhancing the functionality and potential of DAOs.",https://crossdao.opti.domains,bafkreiawdu7cpknjwdcuhdtbw7kfcjz4hnpr4degpx6ckd34lsywjyr2he,bafkreibydilt26fypcrlfxzcmdtmgu2sqenb6rd4qezl2roaux23264nbq,Chomtana,Opti-domains,optidomains,bafkreiezre2h7xpifmkjqrc5b4rivl6x2ifxuicy63eme2ygfce6cxcyri

Pairwise is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, like a dating app, allowing users to choose between pairs of options to signal their preferences as opposed to having to read endless forum posts and vote within a set time period. The system converts these simple subjective inputs into objective, measurable outputs, minimizing the cost and cognitive burden of voting.

## How does it work?

Pairwise started as a seed of an idea from the [big brain algorithm research out of Colony back in 2018](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/). Pairwise is a decentralized voting dapp that aims to make it easier for Web3 communities to signal their preferences and make informed decisions. Pairwise is implemented as a website with its own front end and an open-source backend. Pairwise voting will be compatible with all EVM chains and development is fully open source.

One of the biggest problems in DAOs is lack of engagement in governance processes. The goal of the project is to improve the decision-making process by providing a valuable alternative to traditional voting systems and promoting community engagement in the decision-making process. We are confident that this project has the potential to make a significant impact as a public good and we look forward to the opportunity to bring Pairwise voting to life with your support.

## How does it support Public Goods?

The mission of Pairwise is to be a public good itself (by being free & open source), and by supporting decision making within public good DAOs and projects. It is non-excludable (anyone can use it for free) and non rivalrous (it can work alongside any other governance tool).

![|602x320](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DxDwtj3rHx-EsC87ETeVk4IrNgChTBAN5K9FIhDPwYNVVk7u8uel8DeHsx96Xp967Cbex8wsvEF0IUCpFoJyalVvw8VzHTtfJK8YskSfIovrN1JrrX9PFENXq8in7Tmj5AVwXaF-aSAGJqaX8q1gbyY)Here are a few practical use case studies and specific examples of how Pairwise could benefit public goods in the web3 space:

**Grant Proposals:** Pairwise comparison helps organizations prioritize grant proposals by systematically comparing their potential impact and feasibility, ensuring more effective funding distribution. This is especially useful in cases where there are many projects or initiatives that are requesting funding (retroactive public goods, Gitcoin grants etc.).

**Decentralized Curation and Ranking:** Pairwise can be used to compare, rank and curate projects, content, products, or services, and can serve as a ‚Äúdecentralized suggestion algorithm‚Äù. One use case being explored is with Giveth, where users can vote on projects that they are passionate about, which would then feed into the website ranking. This not only allows the community to vote on what projects are important for them, but it also opens the door for new projects to surface that otherwise would have not received the same exposure.

**User research:** A fun use case is user research, where the community can be polled on what their subjective preferences are. For example, this can be used within any DAO to decide on features as kind of a ‚Äúhot or not‚Äù game, where users can vote on specific designs or traits, to determine which ones are most valued by the community.

**Progress**

**Video Demo**

We have a working demo and are doing our initial user testing with the Giveth Community.

**Differentiation (from other projects)**

Pairwise is similar to Snapshot, but with a specific type of UX. Snapshot votes are built around the expectation that users will go do research in forums and read long-form discussions. Our approach leans into the fact that most of the community isn‚Äôt even going to skim the forum posts and will vote with their gut. The goal is to give a clearer signal of what the community wants through more engagement in fun and simple micro-decisions.

Pairwise shouldn‚Äôt be used for EVERY decision, but we believe it is an important complement to the current voting applications that exist today.

At General Magic, we believe in the power of collaboration in the open-source world. That's why we would be thrilled if Snapshot chose to integrate Pairwise into their platform. However, even if Snapshot decides not to, we are still committed to deploying this feature independently and integrating Snapshot's strategies into our system. We believe that this will benefit the entire governance ecosystem as we work together to create more efficient methods based on algorithms.

Mystic provides APIs and SDKs to help games build their economies. 

**Problem**
Games struggle to monetize NFT trading unless they build their own economy, since external NFT marketplaces often don't enforce royalties and games want trading to happen in-game. This makes games build their own economies, but it's a painful process to do so. Enter Mystic.

**Solution**
Mystic provides APIs, SDKs and whitelabel solutions to help games build peer-to-peer NFT swapping, lending and marketplace experiences with ease. The APIs gives devs creative control, the SDKs allows for in-game implementations and the whitelabel solutions allows for the fastest implementation possible. This way, games can easily build their web3 economies and focus on what matters most - the game.

**Traction**
We have launched recently and implementing a waitlist of 18 projects, which demonstrates that there's demand for what we're building. We're also incubated in Lisbon's leading incubator, Startup Lisboa. We are currently looking to join thriving ecosystems we can contribute to!

**Team**
Our team is the team behind Mysticswap.io, an NFT swapping platform on Ethereum/Polygon. We've been building in web3 since Feb 2022, and have recently pivoted to focus on gaming infrastructure. We say this to say: we're experienced and dedicated builders, committed to long-term outcomes.

A linktree alternative for the decentralized web. Your personal, censorship-resistant hub to showcase your unique identity and creations. With your own Web3 doamain, you'll have complete control over your digital presence, free from centralized control. Effortlessly integrate your social profiles, portfolio, blog, NFTs, videos, podcasts, photos, calendar, and more, all on a single, customizable page.

**The Problem:**

A small percentage of web3 domain holders have set up their decentralized websites due to the complexity of the process. Those who have set up their sites often have very basic designs.

Creating a decentralized website for a Web3 domain can be a complex process, requiring extensive research and technical understanding of concepts such as IPFS, CID, and Content Hash. This can be especially challenging for non-technical users. Because of the above challenges very few users build websites for their web3 domains.

**Our Solution:**
To address this challenge, we have developed a product that simplifies the design, build, and publishing process of decentralized websites for Web3 domains.
**Benefits to the Arbitrum Ecosystem:**

- **.ARB domains** **Adoption**: Promoting easy building on. ARB boosts its adoption, stimulating the Arbitrum ecosystem's growth.
- **Education & Outreach**: Our marketing strategies aim to raise decentralized tech awareness, broadening **Arbitrum**‚Äôs user base.

The decentralised web promises a future that's more open, private, and resilient. However, a significant barrier exists: compatibility with current infrastructure. Most of today's browsers are not equipped to interface with web3 technologies, including Arbitrum Name Service (.arb) records and IPFS content. ARB Gateway, through our domain arb.qa, aims to bridge this divide, acting as a bridge between the centralized and decentralized worlds.

**Objective:**

1. Enable seamless resolution of .arb domains and associated IPFS content.
2. Bring web3 content to mainstream users without requiring them to modify their existing browsing habits.

**How it works:**

- **Reverse Proxy Operation:** arb.qa will function as a reverse proxy for ARB names and IPFS content.
- **Dynamic DNS Capture:** Leveraging a wildcard DNS record, arb.qa will dynamically capture all .arb domain requests.
- **Automatic Resolution:** Upon receiving a request, arb.qa will immediately determine the IPFS contenthash of the demanded .arb record and promptly deliver the related static content over HTTPS.

**The Need:**

- **Inadequate Web2 Infrastructure:** The prevalent web2 infrastructure falls short in accommodating the burgeoning web3 ecosystem.
- **Limited Browser Support:** A majority of browsers today cannot natively access .arb/IPFS.
- **Infrastructure Void:** No established gateway infrastructure exists for .arb domains.

**Funding Request:**
We are seeking funding to:

1. Scale our infrastructure to handle the increasing demand.
2. Develop user-friendly tools to assist developers in integrating .arb into their projects.
3. Launch educational initiatives, ensuring more users and developers understand the potential and utility of .arb/IPFS and web3 content.
4. Improve the robustness of our systems, ensuring high availability and uptime.

**Conclusion:**
By bridging the centralized and decentralized webs, we're not just creating a more open internet, but also ensuring that as many users as possible can experience the benefits of web3. With your support, ARB.QA can break down the barriers preventing mainstream adoption of decentralised technologies.",https://arb.qa,bafkreiab4yfaet72vpolt4srmndxu37z36l24hao4herk7tsqadmmjzvle,bafkreifruwxngx4y2goaxds7tsyrva55excm667by4at6k4tebngwuraku,w3hidayath,1w3io,arbdotqa,bafkreifg6gr62mougoximylnnixvorhotmh3sdhq3aftcfs7dw47fef6g4

One of the reasons is to reduce the transition cost for developers by adopting languages that developers have been using extensively, making it easier to onboard to Arbitrum.

WELLDONE Studio aims to support Arbitrum in line with this goal. We have developed a plugin for multi-chains (WELLDONE Code) that allows smart contracts to be developed in Remix IDE for chains other than EVM. This is an official plugin for Remix IDE.

We currently support seven chains. In this process, we have contributed to supporting languages like Move and Rust in Remix IDE. Therefore, developing an environment in the web IDE where Arbitrum's Rust contracts can be deployed will be a very familiar task for us.

Web IDEs like Remix are crucial for initial developer onboarding. This is because, in Remix IDE, developers don't need to set up their local development environment at all.

For instance, in the case of the Sui Network launched earlier this year, 10% of all contracts were deployed through WELLDONE Code in the first half of the year.

Unitap = Universal Tap (Faucet)

Introduction:

Getting started in crypto and web3 is hard, confusing, and costly for new users. Unitap is here to help. We are building a platform for learning the basics by doing, and distributing project, DAO and gas tokens to onboard the world to web3.

If you have a friend and you want them to learn crypto, send them to https://unitap.app.

How it works:

Unitap provides a series of Taps that remove obstacles for new web3 users in their onboarding path, including:

Gas Tap

To start learning web3, you need a tiny amount of gas, but it‚Äôs often frustrating to get it. Gas Tap solves this.

More than 4,000 users have already claimed over 100,000 drips of gas tokens on 28 different networks, including test networks.

Token Tap 

Claim project and DAO tokens. Token tap allows projects and DAOs to easily democratize governance. Because Unitap claimers are limited in how many types of project or DAO tokens they can claim, they‚Äôre more likely to be interested in holding and using the tokens.

Token tap currently distributes Bitcoin, $SONG, and $BRIGHT. We are going to add many more‚Äìplease contact us if there‚Äôs a token you‚Äôd like to see distributed on Token Tap!

In development:

Prize Tap - Enter to win raffles for larger prizes. Sometimes it‚Äôs more impactful to give more tokens to fewer recipients. We are partnering with ChainLink to provide open and auditable raffles.

Learn Tap - Learn about web3 by using it. Learn Tap guides new users to make their very first steps into web3 including wallet creation, obtaining gas, and doing their first on-chain transactions.

Funder Dashboard - We‚Äôre creating a dashboard to make it easy to create your own distribution on Token tap or Prize tap.  You can set the duration, amount per person, one-time or recurring, and gating (such as BrightID).

Benefits:

Reduced costs: Unitap allows users to claim gas tokens and other digital assets for free, making it affordable to get started with web3.

Easy access: Our Taps provide a simple and intuitive way for users to obtain digital assets, without the need for technical expertise or specialized knowledge.

Sybil resistance: Most faucets are abused by bad actors, sybils and bots. We use BrightID to prevent malicious actors and bots from abusing our faucets, ensuring that each real human can claim their fair share of digital assets. As technology advances (for example, with BrightID‚Äôs new Aura verification method), Unitap will adopt the best anti-sybil solutions.

Claim limits:

For all taps, we limit claims to 5 per user (for example) out of potentially thousands of token choices. This forces claimers to pick the tokens they value most. It provides important feedback and curation‚Äìwith the most valuable and useful tokens rising to the top.

Forus is a cutting-edge privacy solution that empowers users to receive funds while safeguarding their personal wallet address from prying eyes. With Forus, users consistently obtain funds through a fresh stealth address, preserving the utmost privacy in financial transactions Forus creates a fortified and confidential space, granting users the ability to receive funds discreetly through a quick , cheap and user-friendly interface.

## Description ##

When using Forus, you no longer have to be confined to a single wallet address. The issue with sticking to one address is that it can attract prying eyes. For instance, everyone knows that 'vitalik.eth' belongs to Vitalik Buterin. This opens the door to tracking his transaction history and potentially gaining insights into his financial activities. This situation might not sit well with some individuals, right?

Here at Forus, you can bid farewell to the need for a personal wallet address. When you enter forus,  simple generate  a forus key (which is a cryptographic hash not related to any real blockchain address) make sure to securely store your forus key's private Key name as ""signature key"".  Once you have your Forus key, share it with the sender. The sender will then craft a new address for you by doing some fancy math with your forus key , one that neither you nor the sender could predict. From then you dont need to send him any real wallet address he got your forus key when u would transfer you funds a new stealth address would be created on demand which you can control only.


## How it  Works ##

1. The receiver generates a new ""ForusKey,"" which is a one-time, base58 encoded address . Instead of sharing the personal wallet address, the receiver provides the Forus Key to receive funds.(Note : ForusKey is not bound to any blockchain address)

2. The receiver also generates a corresponding ""signature Key"" on demand, which serves as the private key for the Forus Key. This signature should securely saved for future use. (Note :Never share your signature Key with anyone always share ForusKey to receive funds)

3. Next the sender generates a stealth address by doing some fancy math stuff with the receiver's Forus Key and sends funds to this new address. Also sender generates a public key on demand, and publishes it in a designated logs directory. This entire process is completed in a single transaction.

4. The receiver periodically scans the logs directory and perform calculations using his signature Key and the sender's public key. Through Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the receiver derives the private key for the stealth address on which the funds have been sent.

5. With the derived private key, the receiver gains control over that address on which the funds have been sent and can manage the funds received securely.

In summary Forus uses cryptographic algorithms and one-time-use keys that allow users to receive funds through addresses which are created by sender but controlled by receiver.



## Why do u need Forus ? ##

When people start poking into your transactions, they can act like detectives and piece together who you are and what you're doing. It's definitely not cool, right? It's like someone snooping around in your personal diary. But that's where Forus comes in, making sure that your financial stuff remains private





## What next for Forus ? Milestones  ##

Forus is still under development .There are important things we need to work on before it's fully functional and user-friendly. Here's what we have planned.

**1.Making it more User-Friendly**: We want to make sure using Forus is easy and intuitive. We'll improve the design, simplify processes, and make it more user-friendly.

**2.Adding NFTs**: Forus is now limited to coins and tokens only, but we have plans in integrating anonymous nfts transfers too , would expand its capabilities and attract a broader user base.

**3.Testing and Auditing**: We'll conduct thorough testing and audits to find and fix any issues. This is important to make sure Forus is reliable, secure, and stable.

**4.Deploying on the Mainnet and on other evm compatible blockchains** : We would make Forus accessible and compatible with all main blockchain networks .

**5.Relayer feature**: The relayer feature would be added to securely withdraw the funds to the user's personal address without giving the gas fee in native currency . Well forus also supports erc20 tokens but its not possible to pay in tokens.

**6.Adding Cool Features** : We'll keep adding new features based on what our users want. This could mean more privacy options, support for different tokens, or integration with other cool apps.

**7.Cross-Chain Compatibility**: As interoperability becomes more prominent, Forus could explore enabling cross-chain transactions. This would allow users to maintain their privacy while transacting between different networks.

Our main goal with Forus is to make it easy to use while keeping your transactions private and secure. By working on these areas and making the necessary improvements, we hope Forus will become a trusted and widely used solution for private and secure transactions.",https://forus.live,bafkreicxkcxejk54qrnhuqqbdk74535f2g7wng2lyl5bo4rlwaqlulelte,bafkreih5ym5yhgzaga57o7e6s3vxc56fg3iegnzmlkxx76n6hefjpcha3q,oxMaaz,TheForus,the_forus,bafkreiekjrpsyk3clfdjcjvmpvsi2kmuyx5ol7drliziur42fq7adrp2tq

As a team of smart-contract developers, we experience everyday how the tools lack maturity. Our goal is to provide the same seamless development experience as any other mainstream languages. It will thus bring more developers to this awesome ecosystem and accelerate the innovation.

To achieve this, we plan to create sets of VS-Code extensions and Language Servers to support all necessary features such as: 
-	Format on save
-	Static analyser and compiler warnings / errors
-	Go to definitions
-	Function usages
-	Display Natspec doc on display
-	A debugger integration into the LSP
-	Run tests
-	Support of Foundry and Hardhat development frameworks
-	Deploy a smart contract using a browser / mnemonic wallet on a local chain or testnet/mainnet
-	Interact with smart contracts you imported or already deployed
-	Show gas usages of each function when testing
-	A lot more‚Ä¶

The first toolchain will be for solidity, but we want to support other languages too. Since when developing, tools performance is crucial, we will implement all our extensions in rust, using mainly alloy.

We already started the development of a first brick : a linter, which aims to replace Solhint which is slow (javascript) and not maintained anymore. We will release our first version very soon.

We are currently developing the references/definition linkage features and work closely with Paradigm Alloy‚Äôs developers to perform open-source contribution for the missing features in their product.

This grant will help fund weekly stipends for the core team leading Osmium technical & community development‚Äî0xtekgrinder, 0xMemoryGrinder, 0xSwapFeeder, Energycube, Leon, Byfish, Louis.
We will gradually release our extensions as soon as we develop them but we plan to have the solidity toolchain complete within 6 months

We invite you to become a part of this visionary journey by supporting us through the Grant Program.

About:

NFTEarth is not aiming to be just another NFT marketplace; it's a project focused on transforming what non-fungible technology means, and what it enables for all participants in the space. At its core, NFTEarth is an L2 (Layer 2) NFT Marketplace and protocol designed to provide users with an extraordinary platform for buying, selling, and earning rewards through the exchange of digital collectibles and NFTs. But it goes beyond that; NFTEarth is at the forefront of emerging non-fungible technology, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of NFTs including AI integrations using digital avatars from ReadyPlayerMe and powered by Google Cloud Vertex AI.

Building the Future of NFTs:

Our vision is to create a new paradigm for NFTs. NFTEarth is pioneering a novel NFT protocol that leverages cutting-edge technologies. We are proud to be live on Arbitrum, substantially reducing gas costs and ensuring a seamless experience for our users. Additionally, we utilize onchain VRF from Chainlink, enhancing the security and trustworthiness of our platform.

But the project goals don't stop there. We are committed to exploring new and groundbreaking use-cases for non-fungible technology. The scope of the project goals encompass NFT creation and education, as well as the integration of AI solutions directly into NFTs and the protocol marketplace. We aim to be a one-stop destination for all things NFT, with a particular emphasis on Layer 2 scaling networks like Arbitrum.

The Impact We Seek:

NFTEarth's ultimate goal is to make NFTs accessible to a global audience. We understand the immense potential of the NFT market, and we're ready to seize it. According to global NFT statistics, over the next three years, more than 30 million new users are expected to embrace NFTs. NFTEarth aspires to be the welcoming home for the majority of these newcomers. We firmly believe that blockchain scaling solutions are the key to seamlessly introducing them to the captivating world of web3.

We are building a; 

Player-vs-Player betting (duel bet): This product is built with the aim of creating a socio-friendly betting environment, allowing users to wager based on insight against each other in which a winner emerges after the terms set are met. This mechanism is facilitated with the help of our smart contracts. We will be having a wide range of events, sports, crypto, politics, stock, and live events.
We plan to introduce simple and less demanding e-games like cards, word guesses, chess, and snooker for a better gamified experience.

Educational hub: We will be having an educational hub on our platform; this will include educational betting blogs, terms, articles, glossaries, and crypto/sporting newsletters. This will help instill more knowledge in our users, they won‚Äôt only play games but acquire knowledge of what a crypto and web3 ecosystem is and how they can fit in.



What we will offer; 

A wider range of sports, events, crypto, politics, stock and live events.
An easy way to deposit and withdraw for both web2 and web3 users.
An Account abstraction wallet for a better transaction and fund processing experience.
An escrow system for a swift and secure wagering experience.
An educational section that will include a glossary and articles for easy onboarding.



INDUSTRY AWARENESS

Why we think what we're building is going to succeed;

Sport betting in the US is expected to contribute $22.4billion to the US GDP (americangaming.org) we realized that betting/gambling is one of the biggest integrals of today's economy and if web3 as a whole is to onboard through different means, betting is one valid option to look at. According to world gambling statistics (Casino.org), around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble I.e 26% of the world population. 

Gambling is an integral part of every economy. 4 billion people are said to gamble yearly. Case studies like (BC games and rollbit) average over 20 million monthly (according to similar web) traffic which is strictly crypto betting how much more is a web2 accommodating website?
With our research and these statistics, we believe Hemify will be a success.



Who are our target audience?

Our target users are individuals who have an interest in competitive sports or online gaming. These users are likely to be tech-savvy, in the age range of 18+, and have a strong interest in both the excitement of the games and the potential financial gains from betting. 

We aim to attract users who enjoy the strategic and competitive nature of player-vs-player matchups, seeking a platform that offers a safe, transparent, and engaging environment for their betting activities. 

By tailoring our marketing efforts to this demographic, we can effectively identify and target potential users who align with the unique features of our platform.

We are also targeting people of no interest in betting with our educational hub. Part of our marketing activities will focus on this as well.



How Hemify tends to benefit Arbitrum.
 
Our platform will be deployed on Arbitrum, which automatically makes anyone who bets, record a transaction on the network. 
Our account abstraction wallet (deployed on Arbitrum) will also enable users to deposit, withdraw, and store their assets on the platform.

Users can initiate interactions such as placing bets, checking their account balance, and withdrawing funds at any time. 
The seamless experience provided by Arbitrums' scaling technology ensures that users can enjoy a smooth and responsive betting experience, encouraging sustained engagement over time.




How Hemify will be a source of growth for the Arbitrum ecosystem;

It will be a source of growth in terms of onboarding new users through the wager system designed in a way such that existing users can bring in their peers (online/in real life) to wager with them; if this chain continues, it'll increase the number of users on-chain on the network and ecosystem.

We are proud to be working with https://wolpertingergames.com/ that have an impressive catalog of gaming experience and AR expertise. They are part of the https://rcp.family/ Which opens the doors to extensive further development resources.

Overview: 
Jerri‚Äôs World is a pre-apocalyptic mobile game set in 2024 that allows the generic lifeforms, Jerri‚Äôs, to battle the forces of the inhabitants of the Ivory Towers living in what the Jerri‚Äôs  like to call their boardroom paradise.  
Jerri‚Äôs must first choose to break free from the shackles of the Ivory Tower going into the wilds to build a community in order to take back the world and save it from the extractive polluting measures used by the Ivory Tower crowd.  
Using the latest technology in combination with the knowledge of nature and natural systems new coordination and commerce arise.  They are first ignored by the arrogant Ivory Tower groups until the Jerri community's growth starts to inspire more to break free. 
Now the battle starts in earnest.  Jerri‚Äôs realize that there can be no peaceful existence between the two but they refuse to take up arms, instead relying on the power of reason and purpose to infiltrate and destroy the Ivory Tower‚Äôs.  
Jerri‚Äôs protect themselves with better coordination avoiding confrontations and with defensive measures to ensure the safe places they create remain safe.  
The power of the many on the side of regeneration take down tower after tower transforming a once doomed world into a paradise for all generic lifeforms. 

Goals
Bring web2 into web3 seamlessly without making it the focus.

Education about the many ways that regeneration and regenerative finance can tackle the current issues facing the world today.  Polluted air, water, soil, lack of available energy sources that do not add to the problems

Onboarding players into the refi ecosystem through the use of NFT assets that both earn staking rewards as well as being tradable to create an economy within the game and in the real world as ARB assets and tokens

Using the game and AR NFT assets to promote real word actions and earn bounties that help further their in game goals and IRL impacts.  

Generating enough money and social credit to take on in courts the biggest polluters on the planet.

Specifications:
Mobile game platform  
Arbitum NFT marketplace integration
Custodial wallet and non-custodial wallet creation and integration with seamless Fiat currency conversion. Allowing players the option to take the keys or to just play with the blockchain tech running in the background for them.

Milestones:
 
10k downloads
10k bounties collected. 

Game Design:

Your main task is to build a self-sustaining colony in a wasteland by collecting trash, re- and upcycling waste, and destroying polluting artifacts of the Ivorys for resources. 
The basic core game is inspired by base-building and survival-crafting games.
You control the top-down camera to explore the area and tap on interactive objects to break them, harvest them, collect them, or open contextual popups to perform more complex interactions like management tasks.
In addition to in-game gameplay actions, the game also challenges you to perform real-world actions - ranging from cleanups to evidence collection and awareness campaigning - to collect additional rewards & resources for the game.
Your colony represents your (non-custodial) wallet. Everything you build in your colony represents a staked NFT. Collecting, merging, and using the game resources influences the perceived value of these NFTs. Actively trading resources and minted game objects with other players drives the chain utilization.

Meta Game:

You are part of a Trybe, a cluster of players fighting the Ivory's by reclaiming wasteland territory from them and destroying their ‚Äúvalue‚Äù-chains
Every week, you select your affiliation to one Trybe, contributing your achievements in the game to defeat another Ivory Boss in exchange for more territory and valuable rewards
each Ivory Boss stands for an actual real-world polluter and all your in-game staking efforts, gameplay achievements and real-world activities are driving progress to take real, tangible action against that polluter

Core Game Loop:

Explore your Island/Region
Mine basic resources (dismantle old industry structures, break machinery, harvest plants for seeds, collect trash for recycling etc.)
Build your colony with the collected resources
Build crafting & re/upcycling stations to transmute resources
Create & manage a sustainable powergrid
Reclaim wasteland for organic farming and reforestation
Clean & revitalize water & swamps
Create better tools, improve your stations, re-claim more land

The more energy you produce and the ‚Äúgreener‚Äù your colony becomes, the more you contribute to defeating the Ivory Boss for your Trybe. Your contributions are ranked in different tiers within your Trybe. If you cross certain thresholds yourself or with your immediate Trybe-friends, you rank-up in a tier, becoming eligible for a bigger share of the prize & rewards pool that‚Äôs gained from defeating the Ivory Boss - but only if the whole Trybe defeats the Ivory Boss by the end of the week.

Real Action - Real Impact:

Once you are a member of a Trybe, you can get bonus resources for your game by performing real-world actions, e.g.:
Collect photo-evidence of pollution attributable to the ‚Äúbig polluter‚Äù Ivory Boss of your Trybe
Contribute to the Trybe wiki - a hub with resources & information to help the cause
Generate awareness by multiplying messages and campaigns on social media
Every time an Ivy Boss is defeated, parts of the generated staking income and transaction fees will be used to further the cause of going against the real big polluter - by:
class-action lawsuits
media campaigns
sustainable, independent research funding
Donations

Monetization Design:

The FIAT inflow is mainly coming from in-app purchases (IAP) converted to $ARB to buy cosmetic items or get access to improved tools and buildings, faster. Items above a certain rarity grade are minted on-chain as NFTs, and next to the regular resource used for building your colony you can use and trade a token as premium currency to exchange NFTs or speed up building and research projects for your colony.
The players can actively stake in game assets  (NFTs) and tokens in their colony to generate game-resources while we seamlessly do the same for them on chain for a fee of the staking rewards.  This creates the core game loop and ‚Äúdeals damage‚Äù to the Ivory Boss. Items or resources you don‚Äôt need can be traded with other players via the marketplace and peer to peer trading. Some earned in-game assets may not provide the right bonuses for your Trybe, so trading with other players of other Trybes is encouraged.  Exchange items to maximize your contribution to the weekly goal, and thus the global, real-world goals.
An ‚Äúitem fusing‚Äù mechanic is used to combine lower-grade items into higher-grade items. This drains low value resources and items that are generated by players at inflationary scale, creating items with higher value over time that encourage trading. 
Ivy Boss challenges can be built in a way that requires players to ‚Äúrecycle‚Äù items at regular intervals, restoring balance over time to the economy and keeping the influx of FIAT into the game alive.

Community Building & EPIC GOAL:

You can share your Jerri colony with the rest of the playerbase to show off your creativity, but also your achievements in the game. Players are naturally curious to see the creations of the top-tier contributors to the Ivory Boss‚Äô defeat.
The Trybe‚Äôs wiki serves as a community hub to contribute and pull information from. It also serves as a constant reminder and progress tracker for the real-world impact and campaign progress towards the common Epic Goal of going after the big polluters. Every month, the most successful Trybes are featured and supported with an additional ‚Äúcampaign boost‚Äù fueled from the buy-in, staking and transaction rewards.

Location-based Impact:

You can use your Jerri Colony and geo-tag it to a real-world location. Other Jerris can boost your (and their) colony by being in the vicinity of this real location.
This can be used for local communities to highlight their own efforts, e.g. in cleanup, reforestation, or demonstration projects. If enough Jerris lock their colony in a certain area, they can create their own Trybe and evoke an Ivory Boss that they are attacking together, effectively working towards a common goal in the game to get funding or awareness for their local community effort to fight against pollution.
The local Jerri colonies can be visualized as AR overlays for your camera. You can take photos and geo-tag them for public sites, e.g. Google Maps, to draw attention to sites of pollution or positive attention to beneficial projects. Other Jerris can find your colony in the app and actually look at it live, both in AR and in the mobile app.

Imagine a world where the moon is not just a distant celestial body but your canvas for wealth and exploration.

Moonland is an on-chain metaverse which is bringing this idea to life through NFTs and Arbitrum's blockchain technology.

At the core of Moonland Metaverse lies the concept of Lunar NFT Real Estate. These non-fungible tokens represent your exclusive claim to lunar terrain. Each NFT corresponds to a unique piece of the moon's surface, and ownership is just the beginning. It's your golden ticket profit from the untapped resources of the lunar landscape.

Picture this: solar cells on your lunar property harvesting energy packets, which can be traded for $MOON tokens‚Äîthe Moonland's native cryptocurrency. Use your earnings to unlock even more lunar potential, from expanding your real estate holdings to venturing into lunar mining operations.

The moon is no longer out of reach; it's your playground for financial growth. Moonland Metaverse is where NFTs come to life, where you can own, explore, and earn in ways you've never imagined.

Ethereum Mexico is a driving force for Ethereum growth in Mexico, educating individuals on blockchain technology and promoting Ethereum values. Serving as a link between the Ethereum community, the Ethereum Foundation, and Mexico's local communities.

Our organization offers IRL Meetups, Twitter Spaces, Workshops, and educational content. One of their major 2023 initiatives is a large event in Mexico City, set for Q4, expecting over 800 attendees. This event aims to foster education and innovation within the Ethereum community.

Having engaged in events like, ETHMexico, #RoadToDevcon and EthLATAM since June 2022, Ethereum Mexico wants to move beyond just market talk and truly display Ethereum's transformative power.

**Motivation:**
The project is fueled by a pressing need to fill the educational and resource gap in Mexico concerning Ethereum and blockchain technology. It aims to create a more inclusive and diverse Ethereum community in Mexico, thereby contributing to the global Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum Mexico is not just another crypto initiative; it's a mission-driven project that focuses on real-world impact. Far from falling into speculative conversations, it aims to educate people about the transformative power of Ethereum as public infrastructure.

**Primary Objectives:**
- To educate individuals about the safe and effective use of blockchain technology, focusing on the Ethereum ecosystem.
- To disseminate the core values and tools of Ethereum and Web3 to a broader audience.
- To provide unwavering support and assistance to local communities in conceptualizing, building, and scaling Ethereum-related projects.

Ethereum News is a daily brief covering the latest in Ethereum. There is so much going on that it's impossible to catch up! Our goal is to update you on the latest ecosystem project updates, network upgrades, security incidents, and scaling improvements. We release a podcast and a newsletter every weekday.

Over the past year, we have covered 50+ updates from the Arbitrum ecosystem. **An archive of Arbitrum-related news can be found [here](https://ethdaily.io/tag/arbitrum/)**

### **Why Fund Us**
We aim to support the broader Ethereum and web3 ecosystem. This grant will help us continue the production of the daily briefing. As we continue to grow, we help spread awareness about important updates and new projects in the ecosystem.

### **Grant Use**
This grant will continue the production of Ethereum News. We‚Äôve covered the initial costs of running the podcast (hosting, software, hardware) over the last year. We are extremely thankful for our early Gitcoin supporters, who helped us register our ENS domain! We have since launched our website (ethdaily.io). We are exploring ways to monetize and prefer to stay a public good.

### Goal2: Incubator Programs

Beyond content creation, IMN serves as an incubator for aspiring global multi-lingual DAOs. The project fosters an environment where individuals with diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds can leverage their expertise to independently onboard people to crypto through education in their own languages. By providing guidance and support, IMN nurtures these emerging communities and equips them with the tools needed to thrive independently.

### üåç‚ú®üå± Successes and Spin-offs

Over its successful two-year journey, IMN has achieved remarkable milestones. One notable accomplishment is the creation of independent communities within Latin America. Bankless Brasil ([link](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bankless-br-dao-proposal-for-season-4/3340)) and Nacion Bankless/Bankless in Spanish ([link](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bankless-in-spanish-a-new-subdao-of-banklessdao/5386)) are two spin-off communities that have emerged from IMN. These communities embody the vision and values of the Bankless mission, focusing on empowering individuals within their respective regions to understand and use crypto in their everyday lives.

These spin-offs demonstrate IMN's effectiveness in enabling newbies to participate in DAO governance, access independent funding opportunities and connect with local communities. By offering guidance and fostering self-sustainability, the IMN has played a pivotal role in accelerating the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology worldwide.

With its commitment to inclusivity, education, and community building, IMN continues to make significant strides in empowering individuals from diverse backgrounds to embrace the world of crypto and contribute to the broader crypto ecosystem.

Only 5% of the world‚Äôs population are native English speakers, and roughly 15% speak English on some level. The initial goal of the IMN project is to reach the remaining 80%. First by translating and distributing content about blockchain technology, DeFi, The Metaverse and Web 3.


The International Media Nodes project believes in the liberating effect of going Bankless and what it can do for improving financial wellbeing and stability throughout the world. Creating and maintaining communities of people who do not speak English and educating them/opening the door for them to onboard on the Web3, is one of the most crucial pieces of infrastructure if we want the Web3 to be any different from Web2.

For the Arbitrum ecosystem, we have written/translated more than 10 newsletters. The 1st one of them was published in June 2023. Here are the most viewed and impactful ones -->

1.  [How to get access to Arbitrum](https://banklessua.substack.com/p/arbitrum)

 Projects seem to be actively using the capabilities of the Arbitrum network and creating valuable products for users. With increased transaction capacity and reduced fees, the Arbitrum network has the potential to become one of the leading platforms for the development of decentralized finance (DeFi). The introduction of events such as the Arbitrum Odyssey can stimulate the growth of activity and user interest in this network.

2. [Getting started with Arbitrum Nova](https://banklessua.substack.com/p/arbitrum-nova)

 The article discusses Arbitrum Nova, which is a second-tier (L2) scaling solution designed to optimize high-volume transactions in the Web3 gaming and social applications industries. Here are the main information and conclusions from this article:

Arbitrum Nova and its key features:

Arbitrum Nova was introduced by Arbitrum in June 2022.
This optimistic L2 stablecoin is built on AnyTrust technology and is designed for ultra-low-cost transactions and strong security guarantees.
It is aimed at supporting gaming and social applications.
The difference between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One:

One of the key differences between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One is the processing of transaction data. Arbitrum One continuously transfers all transaction data to Ethereum, while Nova uses a data availability committee (DAC) to manage data efficiently, which can significantly reduce costs.
Activity on Arbitrum Nova:

At the time of writing, Arbitrum Nova was the 14th largest L2 in the crypto economy with a significant total blocked value (TVL) of approximately $14.4 million. This is certainly less than Arbitrum One, but this L2 still has the potential to grow.
Programs on Arbitrum Nova:

The article provides information about some of the gaming and social applications that use or are being developed on the basis of Arbitrum Nova. One example is Reddit, which is moving its Community Points system to Nova.
Search for programs on Arbitrum Nova:

For those interested in finding programs that use Arbitrum Nova, the article points to a resource called the ""Arbitrum Nova Portal,"" where you can find a list of projects by different cryptocurrency categories.
The article provides a general overview of Arbitrum Nova, its potential, and the main characteristics that make it attractive for gaming and social applications in the crypto environment. This initiative can contribute to the further development of the Arbitrum network and create new opportunities in the future.

3. [How ARBITRUM is changing the future of airdrops](https://banklessua.substack.com/p/arbitrum-f70)

The launch of the Arbitrum $ARB was an important moment for cryptocurrencies and Ethereum, but it was also a huge milestone for the ether. The question now is how projects will change their thinking about incentivizing tokens for early adopters after ARB.

4. [5 opportunities on Arbitrum right nowüî•](https://banklessua.substack.com/p/5-arbitrum-)

 *Arbitrum One is currently the most popular second-tier scaling solution for Ethereum, offering the best liquidity - at least for the moment.

This Bankless tactic covers several hot Arbitrum features that you can try out today!

**Goal:** To explore interesting Arbitrum projects
**Skills:** Intermediate
**Time commitment:** 1 hour
**Return on investment (ROI):** Up to 60% APR at current rates

5. [ Everything you need to know about Arbitrum Airdrop](https://banklessua.substack.com/p/arbitrum-airdrop)

 Finally, ARB is here. Arbitrum is (finally) releasing its token.

One of the most anticipated token launches in the history of cryptocurrencies, ARB will be used to manage the Arbitrum ecosystem, and yes, it will be released to early adopters.

But this is not the only important news of the day.

Arbitrum has also announced Arbitrum Orbit, a framework for building L3s that will utilize Arbitrum-based rollups.

Do you have a few minutes to take a break from watching TradFi die? If so, I'll tell you everything you need to know about ARB and Orbit, their impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem, and how these releases could affect the increasingly fierce Layer 2 Wars.

Let's dive in.

**Our newsletters have 1,100+ views per month and help people understand the crypto ecosystem, including Arbitrum, in the local Ukrainian language.**

Naci√≥n Bankless subDAO: an independent entity spun out of BanklessDAO to enable spanish speaking populations to #gobankless to know how to DeFi and Game inside the web3 ecosystem

What is Naci√≥n Bankless?

Gm Arbinauts
We are Naci√≥n Bankless a subDAO of BanklessDAO that brings the tools, content and knowledge to the hispano speakers of the world. We have a very nice group of traders, gamers, game designers and enthusiasts. 

With the start of our work in July 2021, we are currently living the new vibes in the ecosystem with a more aligned team and with the ethos of decentralization and control of the work and leadership inside our team
We are a Latin American project with a strong belief in disruptive and conscious technology. Actually in adaptive and growing process, with multiple alliances and structure to offer a great line of decentralized, honest and governable projects. 
We are governed by the BanklessDAO constitution, Ethereum Ethos, Local ethics within our countries, with the intention to bring the knowledge, opportunities, values and enthusiasm of web3 to the next billion users.

General Description
By educating and onboarding new users directly to Arbitrum, we will enable the people of LatAm to participate in the global crypto economy, increase usage of the arbitrum chain and enable average people to #gobankless

In our experience most projects in Latin America are dedicated to teaching basic content or content which educates people on how to use crypto apps, however at BanklessDAO, we guide our contributors to change their traditional mindset and enter the world of cooperation, coordination and collective work. We want people to be able to opt-in to the world of smart contract based cooperation for all aspects of their life, and not just finance. 

While most of the existing crypto content is geared towards the average western user, we want to make original content focusing on the Latin American audience. We want to give a voice and a vote to our peers who face the absence of crypto on- and off-ramps, poor internet connections and certainly language barriers.
With this in mind, Naci√≥n Bankless is in the process of growing and is looking for a robust partner, who understands the values of decentralization, holacracy, coordination and positive sum thinking. We see a seed in Arbitrum, in values, honor and ethos, when everyone has turned to new projects or new layers in the ecosystem, we are very committed with the feelings and objectives that Arb has, we remain constant and believe in the universe immersed in the projects with the highest quality and work, so we are proud, at least to be read by the creators of the technologies of the future.
Here are specific details on how this proposal and its contributors are aligned with the Arbitrum mission and vision.

Rationale
We are Blockchain agnostic, but our vibes and heart rely on Ethereum values and the decentralization processes. And we have another reasons: 

Ethereum-aligned:
 Contributors of Naci√≥n Bankless and the content we have created have been aligned with ethereum values since Day 1.
Sustainable: 
While we propose a 3 month test period to offer the community a glimpse of what we are capable of, we will also keep the community regularly updated on our activities and return with another proposal if the Arbitrum community is satisfied with our performance.
Socially inclusive: 
By funding this proposal we believe that differences in knowledge, resources, geography, language, and life experience would be seen as opportunities to learn and to grow the community.
Technically inclusive: 
We want to make it possible for ordinary people, with ordinary computer systems, to participate as fully as possible in the Arbitrum protocol if they wish to do so.
User-focused: 
Our activities are geared toward end user education and adoption
In our Newsletters: 
We create, produce, engage and user oriented in our market experiences, with original content in Spanish which is specifically catered to solving the challenges faced by the Latin American audience

Specifications 

We divide this proposal into three key objectives.

ArbiSocks utilizes Optimistic rollups technology to design a unique, limited-edition tokenized socks that are represented by redeemable tokens.

Fair Launch
The ASOCKS token has a limited supply of 5,000 and will be distributed in a way that gives everyone a chance to own a unique piece of the tokenized asset. The lion‚Äôs share of the tokens won‚Äôt go to friends, developers, venture capital firms, advisors, partners, or any other groups who can dump the tokens in the future.

Why we are different:
The ASOCKS token has a limited supply of 5,000 and will be distributed in a way that gives everyone a chance to own a unique piece of the tokenized asset. The lion‚Äôs share of the tokens won‚Äôt go to friends, developers, venture capital firms, advisors, partners, or any other groups who can dump the tokens in the future.

The $ASOCKS token and NFT will have a fixed supply of 5,000 and each unit will be backed by a physical sock. ArbiSocks work similarly to unisocks, with the cost per pair of socks varying according to the liquidity pool. To claim the physical pair, you need to burn a minimum of 1 out of 5,000 $ASOCKS tokens, which decreases the overall supply and elevates the scarcity (and thus, the worth) of the remaining socks.


Future Goal
Customizable: Our aim is to offer customization options that empower users to personalize their design using our unique features.

We are a public goods data platform designed specifically for L2 scaling solutions to analyze fundamentals as well as more detailed blockspace usage with a curated set of categories. Our goal is to empower developers and users alike by providing them with a comprehensive overview of fundamental metrics, on-chain data, and multi-lingual educational resources, to help them make informed decisions when selecting their L2 chain to build on.

![growthepie Landing Page](https://ixed.co/wp-content/uploads/growthepie/gtp-landing-page.png ""growthepie"")

## Our goals and usage of funds üöÄ

- **Building of our Knowledge hub**: Tied with our metrics, we provide educational content for both developers and consumers to understand data and their specific use cases more. Also, what each of the events readable from data means for a specific Layer-2 and what this means compared to other L2 chains. Additional educational content for each metric brings data-based decision-making closer to each end-user/developer/investor. 
- **Spanish localization** of our platform and educational content *(Knowledge)*.
- **Introduction of more metrics**, namely: Fully Diluted Valuation, Smart Contract Creation, and Active Developers.
- **Addition of more chains**


## What can you do on our platform currently? üßê

### Fundamental Metrics Chain Comparisons

Currently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics for Layer-2s, focusing on 5 chains: Arbitrum One, Base, OP Mainnet, Immutable X, Polygon zkEVM, and zkSync Era.

We have 4 main categories that allow you to analyze the following fundamental metrics:

Activity
- **Daily Active Addresses**: The number of unique daily addresses that interacted with a chain.
- **Transaction Count**: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts, excluding system transactions.

Value Locked
- **Stablecoin Market Cap**: The sum of stablecoins that are locked on the chain.
- **Total Value Locked**: The sum of all funds locked on the chain.

Economics
- **Fees Paid by Users**: The sum of fees that were paid by users of the chain in gas fees or, in the case of chains like Immutable X, the amount of fees that were paid to the protocol wallet.
- **Rent Paid to L1**: The gas fees paid by L2s to post transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.
- **Onchain Profit**: The net profit of L2s, accounting for revenues as L2 gas fees collected and expenses as posting transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.

Convenience
- **Transaction Costs**: The median amount that is paid per transaction.


![Fundamental Metrics](https://ixed.co/wp-content/uploads/growthepie/gtp-transaction-costs.gif ""growthepie Transaction Costs Metric"")


### Blockspace Explorer
Recently, we introduced our **Blockspace Explorer**:
  - An overview of chains' high-level blockspace usage. All expressed in shares of a chain's total blockspace.
  - A comparison for available Layer-2s for their usage in specific categories, ranging from NFT, Token Transfers to Socials applications. For each of these and more categories, we have a set of subcategories that allow you to filter in more detail and compare which category is more used on which chain.
- For each category/subcategory users can see the most-used smart contracts ranked in a table and make sense of how the chain is being used

![Blockspace Demo](https://ixed.co/wp-content/uploads/growthepie/gtp-blockspace.gif ""growthepie Blockspace Analytics Demo"")


### Single Chain Metrics All-in-One

You can compare chains amongst each other with all the metrics mentioned. Additionally, you have chain-specific pages that allow you to have a glance at all metrics for the particular chain at once. *(Single Chain Page)*

In addition, column owners can choose to set their columns as paid columns, where users must pay a subscription fee for a certain period of time (monthly, quarterly, yearly) to access the content. Onlyfun supports payment for columns with multiple chains and currencies, and column owners can choose the currencies they prefer to support based on their preferences and needs.

Accelerating capacity building, economic empowerment, and financial freedom in Africa through decentralized media. Bankless Africa educates and onboards everyday Africans to crypto/Web3 by promoting and propagating truly decentralized media, culture, and education to drive the adoption of trustless, decentralized infrastructures and money systems across Africa. 
We believe Crypto offers a better future for Africa, and Bankless Africa is here to help steer Africa into that future!

# Why this Project?
There‚Äôs a massive gap in legit crypto education that hinders the widespread adoption and understanding of crypto as a transformative technology in Africa. This has led to many falling victim to scams, making uninformed investment decisions, and missing out on the opportunities presented by crypto/web3. Beyond media, there are fewer communities in Africa focused on deliberate onboarding and training of everyday Africans to actively participate in the web3 space in areas such as contributing in DAOs via governance, operations, community participation, etc. . 
# Project Impact

Bankless Africa recognizes the critical need for accessible and trustworthy crypto education, deliberate web3 onboarding, capacity building and empowering more Africans to participate in DAOs and web3 projects in general. So we have been on a journey to make these possible through:

* Decentralized Media
* Community Building pods
* DAO participation by requiring members to engage in governance activities and also use web3 tooling for coordination, collaboration, project management

## MEDIA - Building the Crypto education and Information Hub of Africa

The Bankless Africa media is one of the most comprehensive and established platforms for educating and informing Africans about all things crypto/web3. It‚Äôs a commitment to providing accurate, reliable, and up-to-date information that ensures that individuals are guided on their web3 journey in a relevant way. The Bankless Africa Media includes:

### The Bankless Africa Podcast
The Bankless Africa Podcast highlights projects, ecosystems, and people making impact and driving the adoption of decentralized technologies across Africa. Another notable show from Bankless Africa is Sats & Gwei, a weekly roll-up of crypto/web3 headlines across the African continent. Together these podcast serves as a great place for everyday Africans to get relevant and great crypto education and information while also serving as a window for people outside Africa to catch up on all the crypto/web3 innovations, news and updates in Africa. It is no surprise that the podcast has grown into one of the biggest crypto podcasts in Africa with over 30,000 All time downloads and still growing. We have published over 80 episodes!

### Community - Onboarding, Capacity Building, web3 participation

The Bankless Africa community takes a grounded approach towards onboarding, capacity building, and empowering everyday Africans to participate in web3, from contributing to DAOs to starting their own projects and everything else in between. The Bankless Africa community consists of pods that serve as talent/skill hubs for members interested in developing specific skills and engaging in the community and the web3 space as a whole. This model of community setup has made Bankless Africa a great catalyst for its members and Africans to start their crypto journey from complete novices to becoming degens, regens, DAO participants, writers, researchers, coders, podcasters, and everything else in between. We achieve these due to a rich tapestry of activities designed to not just introduce but also immerse our community members into the world of web3. Some of these events include: 

1. Web3 Knowledge Sessions:
Education forms the bedrock of adoption. Our knowledge sessions are tailored to provide a deep dive into the underlying principles, technologies, and innovations driving the Web3 space. Through these sessions, we demystify complex topics, ensuring every member has a solid foundational understanding of the decentralized future.

2. Web3 How-To Sessions:
Knowledge is power, but practical know-how is empowerment. Beyond theoretical insights, our how-to sessions offer hands-on guidance on navigating the Web3 ecosystem, from setting up wallets to engaging with decentralized applications. These sessions are crucial for those looking to transition from passive observers to active participants in the digital frontier. The session also includes how to use web3 and DAO toolings and how to contribute in DAOs such as voting on proposals, writing proposals, etc. 


3. Web3 Quests:
Learning is most effective when it's engaging and rewarding. Our Web3 Quests gamify the educational experience, allowing participants to undertake challenges, hone their Web3 skills, and stand a chance to win exciting prizes. This approach not only incentivizes learning but also solidifies knowledge through practical application.

4. Cohort-Based Learning Programs:
Collaborative learning accelerates understanding. Our cohort-based programs, like the writers' upskilling initiative, bring together like-minded individuals to learn, share, and grow collectively. By fostering a sense of community and collaboration, we ensure that members benefit from diverse perspectives and experiences, further enriching their Web3 journey.

6. Game Night:
Building a community isn't just about learning; it's about connecting and having fun together. Our Game Nights serve as a relaxed space where members can unwind, bond, and engage in friendly competition. Beyond entertainment, these sessions subtly incorporate Web3 elements, further familiarizing members with the ecosystem in a laid-back setting. It reinforces the idea that Web3 isn't just about technology, but also about people, connections, and shared experiences.

7. Twitter Space
While the heart of Bankless Africa thrives within our community, we recognize the importance of casting a wider net to truly catalyze change on the continent. Our foray into hosting Twitter Spaces is a testament to this commitment. Twitter, with its vast and diverse user base, offers an unparalleled platform to reach a broader audience, many of whom are yet to be introduced to the Web3 realm. By hosting spaces on this platform, we are essentially setting up open classrooms, allowing curious minds to stumble upon, listen in, engage, and get a taste of the decentralized future. These outward-facing programs aren't just about the dissemination of knowledge, but also about sparking conversations, challenging the status quo, and democratizing access to Web3 education. Every Twitter Space we host is an open invitation to the masses, signaling that the Web3 revolution isn't an exclusive club, but a collective journey, and everyone's invited.

8. Meet Ups
Meet ups are a great way to bring people together and build a community around a shared interest. By organizing meet ups, we create a space where people share their ideas and experiences related to blockchain technology. We organize Meet ups to facilitate impact onboarding where we educate and onboard people on how to use web3 technologies such downloading wallets, engaging in simple transactions etc.

## Abstract
We are [**Atoma**](https://sebix.notion.site/Axis-of-Communication-46f7f261ba584f02a09b86036a7e99af), a team emerged from MakerDAO's Ambassador Program. We offer a wide range of solutions for growth and community building for spanish-speaking audiences, including two-way quality translations, content creation and educational resources. Our primary focus lies in branding and education efforts targeted specifically at the Latin American market of active and potential users.

### Please note that this proposal is a _pilot_ of a bigger project for the Arbitrum Protocol. [**You can read the full proposal here**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-fund-atomas-project-a-growth-communications-proposal-for-arbitrum/16165).

## Motivation

Latin America is one of the most rapidly growing regions when it comes to crypto and Web3 adoption, with an expanding tech-savvy population and a huge potential for widespread financial inclusion.

The combination between innovation, talents, and the need for financial, technological and economic solutions produce highly engaged and robust communities, resulting in an ever-growing number of potential users and developers. Given this context and taking into account the core values of the DAO, a symbiotic and mutually enriching relationship between Arbitrum and LATAM can be forged. If you want to know more about how we envision this, feel free to read our document: [**_Why Latin America? Why Arbitrum?_**](https://sebix.notion.site/Atoma-Communications-Growth-46f7f261ba584f02a09b86036a7e99af)

Our collaborative efforts aim to empower Arbitrum in effectively delivering their vision to a broader audience, nurturing trust and cultivating robust communities surrounding their offerings.

The team has a track record of dedicated contributions during the last two years within the MakerDAO ecosystem. Some of our most relevant outcomes include the creation of [**MakerDAO's official website in Spanish**](https://latam.makerdao.com/), the complete translation of [**official documentation**](https://manual.makerdao.com/v/mom-spanish/) and the successful establishment of the pioneering [**Latin America Delegate Platform**](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/cvc-creation-sovereign-finance-cvc/20868) within the DAO‚Äôs framework.

### Primary objectives

- **Attracting New Users and Enhancing Participation in Arbitrum**
    - Building a community and disseminating information in Spanish can significantly widen Arbitrum's reach and attract new users.
    - Providing clear explanations about governance decisions in Spanish can engage users who might otherwise feel disconnected due to language barriers. This proactive approach fosters a sense of involvement and inclusion, encouraging broader participation.

- **Providing Educational Resources for Spanish-Speaking Audiences**
    - Educating the Spanish-speaking audience about the purpose, features, and potential of Arbitrum is important in order for the protocol to fulfill some of its core values, such as being socially and technically inclusive, user-focused, neutral and open. Also, this initiative aligns with the ethos of Ethereum.
    - By offering educational resources in Spanish, potential users can gain a better understanding of how Arbitrum operates, its benefits, and how it fits into the broader context of the Ethereum scalability.

- **Promoting Benefits and Governance Participation**
    - Promoting the advantages and possibilities presented by Arbitrum can emphasize the opportunity to influence the direction of the platform through governance participation. 
    - This approach not only attracts attention but also nurtures a sense of ownership and involvement in shaping the evolution of Arbitrum.


In essence, these three points collectively contribute to build a stronger, more informed and engaged community around Arbitrum within the Spanish-speaking audience, with a specific focus on Latin America's dynamic and fast growing crypto landscape.

### What will we deliver

- **Arbitrum's Official Website in Spanish**
    - Creation of an official Arbitrum website for the spanish-speaking community.
        - This website will serve as a gateway to Arbitrum for new users in the region, providing access to Arbitrum's resources and showcasing original content created by our project.
        - The team will collaborate with relevant Arbitrum Foundation stakeholders to secure an official domain for this purpose.

- **Evergreen Content Translation**
    - Begin the professional translation of [**Arbitrum's Docs**](https://docs.arbitrum.io/) website.

- **Original Content Creation**

    - Creation of **Arbitrum's very own Introductory Portal**.
    
        By providing an intuitive and comprehensive portal, the DAO can streamline the onboarding process for new participants, offering educational resources about the Web3 and L2 ecosystem. 
    
        This website will attract a broader audience of stakeholders and allow community members to gain deeper understanding of Arbitrum's unique value proposition, DAO's governance structure and decision-making processes.   
    - Creation of **educational threads** for the @Arbitrum_esp X account.
    
         Through these diverse content formats, the project can effectively cater to a broad audience, from tech-savvy developers to crypto enthusiasts and newcomers seeking knowledge about Web3 solutions.

    - Monthly **Newsletters**
        
        Creation of a monthly newsletter in Spanish designed to inform and attract community members regarding Arbitrum's protocol, while also incorporating relevant ecosystem news from Latin America to appeal to potential new users from the region.
        
        Newsletters will provide updates on the latest developments, features, and benefits of Arbitrum's protocol, as well as its governance processes, community's proposals and votings, and would be posted on the Arbitrum Forum.

- **Harnessing the Power of X (Formerly Twitter)**
    
    - A [**comprehensive strategy**](https://fourth-millennium-f8b.notion.site/Content-Social-Media-Strategy-Arbitrum-ESP-a56ea7f3c18746e8ac66f94a8b017b69) has been developed by the Atoma team to bring educational and useful content in an attractive way to this channel.

## Rationale

As a sustainable, socially inclusive and user-focused proposal aimed towards growing the ecosystem by means of community building, content creation for social media, translation of documentation into Spanish and further educational efforts, this proposal is perfectly aligned with the guiding values and strategic priorities of the Arbitrum DAO as per its Constitution.

### Two Month's Milestones

- **OCT-NOV, 2023**
    - Create an official Arbitrum website for spanish-speaking users to work as a gateway into the protocol.
    - Initiate the official full translation of [**Arbitrum's Docs website**](https://docs.arbitrum.io/) to spanish and work with DAO's relevant stakeholders to ensure the optimization of the translated content for seamless integration into the Decosaurus platform.
        - The team will deliver the full professional translation of Arbitrum's [**Introductory Docs**](https://docs.arbitrum.io/intro).
        - The team will also handle quality assurance for existing community translations, ensuring they are adapted to match the format of the rest of the translations.
    - Start the implementation of a **social media content strategy**, including a content calendar, target audience analysis, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to track engagement and reach.
    - Implement a **comprehensive X (Formerly Twitter) growth strategy** for the @Arbitrum_esp account to achieve **15% increase in X followers** and **40% increase in impressions within two months**. This strategy includes a combination of targeted content creation, strategic use of trends, and regular analysis of follower growth and engagement metrics. The team will continuously monitor and optimize the strategy based on data to maximize effectiveness.
    - **Develop and publish at least 8 new educational resources** for Arbitrum's new website in spanish. These resources will provide valuable and actionable information to effectively engage the audience.
    - Create **monthly newsletters**.
        - To be posted on Arbitrum's Forum and the new official website for spanish-speaking audience.

##### As previously mentioned, these milestones are part of a bigger project. [**You can read the full proposal here**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-fund-atomas-project-a-growth-communications-proposal-for-arbitrum/16165).

We have realized there are so big language barriers between international and Japanese crypto markets because of the languages. Our mission is to contribute in Web3 education by lowering the language barrier by providing quality contents in Japanese and spread the words and help more people having interest in international markets. We have done over 200 AMAs in these few years, publishing contents about Web3 like how to avoid rug or latest news, and translating other contents from English communities.

Speaking with founders, developers, creators, governance participants, and security experts, the intention is to provide a 360-degree perspective on Arbitrum. From the technical architecture enabling fast, low-cost transactions to the incentives attracting builders and users, this series will uncover Arbitrum's core innovations.

By sharing insights direct from Arbitrum's community (including from events, hackathons, developer bootcamps, and sponsor initiatives) this will serve as a snapshot of existing use cases, governance, and pragmatic educational resources for getting involved. 
These first-hand experiences demonstrate Arbitrum's capabilities, inspiring others to build.

The goal is twofold - educate stakeholders outside the Arbitrum ecosystem whilst simultaneously empowering those within it to become more effective contributors. Lowering the barriers to participation means creating digestible and shareable content that makes Arbitrum more accessible.

The end result will be an invaluable corpus of knowledge on Ethereum's leading layer 2. From core concepts to real-world applications, the inner workings of Arbitrum will be unpacked assiduously with the aim of enhancing understanding across the Ethereum community (and beyond) while providing quality resources that enable builders to harness Arbitrum's potential.

![Thunder Chat App](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/644a1d20276639b1bf2ddf93_ThunderChat_Header.png)

##### Introduction
Thunder is a blockchain project that aims to provide a secure messaging platform for users. With the rise of web3 technologies, users are more aware of the importance of privacy and security. Thunder leverages the ERC-4337 technology so we can onboard the mass adoption of users. Users do not need to go through the hassle of securing seed phrases to interact with the blockchain. Social recovery of accounts is possible and gasless transactions can be achieved via third parties.

##### Problem Statement
The current messaging platforms in the market, such as Telegram and WhatsApp, have been criticised for their lack of privacy and security. These platforms collect user data and use it for targeted advertising or share it with third-party companies. This puts the privacy of users at risk and raises concerns about data breaches and cyber attacks.

##### Solution
Thunder solves this problem by encrypting messages before storing them on the blockchain. The contents stored on the blockchain is immutable and only the intended parties are given access to this encrypted information. Thunder does not collect any user data and does not share it with third-party companies. This provides users with complete control over their data and ensures that their privacy is protected. Mass adoption of this chat application is further cemented by the ease of account creation via ERC-4337 technology.

![Chat App Screen 1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/644a1d18858d286913c6122a_ThunderChat_1.png)

##### Features

Thunder offers the following features:

###### Seamless account creation
Thunder uses ERC-4337 technology to create an account seamlessly for end users. Users do not need to go through the hassle of understanding and securing seed phrases to interact with the blockchain. The smooth chatting experience makes it such that users do not even know they are interacting via the blockchain.

###### Secure messaging
Thunder uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol combined with an AES-256 GCM encryption scheme to provide end-to-end data encryption. All messages are secure and private. This means that only the sender and the recipient can read the messages, and no one else, not even Thunder, can access them.

The following diagram shows the process flow of Thunder:
![Process Flow 1](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/64d6c7773365e9c659de89be_01_ER_Diagram_Thunder_Chat_User_Profile.png)
![Process Flow 2](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/64d6c77c456341124ba89fba_02_ER_Diagram_%20Thunder_Chat_Message.png)
![Process Flow 3](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/64d6c77e5ac97fcf236e2d41_03_ER_Diagram_Thunder_Chat_Messaging.png)

###### Decentralized storage
Thunder stores user data on the blockchain, ensuring that it is immutable and cannot be tampered with. This means that user data is not stored on centralized servers, which are vulnerable to attacks and data breaches. Instead, user data is stored on a decentralized network of nodes, which ensures that it is available at all times and cannot be lost.

###### User privacy
Thunder does not collect any user data and does not share it with third-party companies, ensuring that user privacy is protected. This means that users have complete control over their data and can choose what they want to share with other parties.

###### Gas-less payment
Chat contents are written on the blockchain without consumers needing to pay a single dollar. A paymaster concept is introduced in our application to facilitate seamless interaction between users.

###### Open-source
Thunder is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and review its code. This ensures that Thunder is transparent and accountable to its users, and that its code is auditable and secure.

![Chat App Screen 3](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6311f8dd72d1d12f9b55b9ce/644a1d1de370efa38f95bb48_ThunderChat_3.png)

##### Driving user adoption
We are working on a Chat API to allow all Arbitrum games and projects to integrate chat function with minimal effort.

##### Obstacles and Challenges
Gas fees are currently the biggest challenge for our project. We are currently exploring to launch our own Orbit AnyTrust chain or collaborate with existing Orbit chains.

##### Conclusion
With Thunder, users can communicate with each other securely and privately without worrying about their data being collected or shared with third-party companies. Our mission is to make Thunder the first blockchain killer app that successfully appeals to the masses, onboarding the next billion users onto web3.


##### Status Update
As of Aug 2023, our MVP has been built and we are currently carrying out internal testing before we upload it to Google Playstore and Apple Store for public beta testing.

As of Sep 2023, our MVP can be downloaded from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thunder.chat

Our app is still pending approval for Apple Store downloads.

Startup companies and projects looking to build on Arbitrum are having a hard time finding competent talents that will make their ideas come to reality. 

Being a new protocol, the number of developers who know how to develop on Arbitrum are very scarce, this gap needs to be filled in order to make the Arbitrum Ecosystem thrive and prosper.

The Blockchain Lead Organization and Knowledge Center or The BLOKC focuses on providing blockchain education, training and certification in the PH that are instructor-led and hands-on. Our program is intensive and focuses on practical application.

We have over 60+ university partners and we are running various blockchain programs from Training-the-Trainers, Bootcamps, Hackathons and Community Meetup - mostly happening in Universities.

Since ArbitrumOne is also going to use RUST, it gives our students that are trained in Solana, Cosmos & Polkadot the more reason to learn Arbitrum.

Our ultimate goal and objective is to provide and produce talent pipeline of competent developers that are CERTIFIED ARBITRUM DEVELOPERS to help companies and startup projects that are looking to build on top of Arbitrum and also produce potential deal flow for the Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs for potential investments.

Among the foreign attendees we had people from Argentina, USA, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Chile. Also 22% of the attendees were women, this is a big step in our way to include women in blockchain, this was achieved thanks to the active collaboration with local communities led by women.





This grant will help us bring Ethereum education to people in other cities in Peru such as Cusco, Arequipa and Huancayo. We already have the Ethereum Starter Pack in collaboration with ETH Kipu ready¬†to¬†be delivered to these communities.

# Help support LexDAO‚Äôs operational costs

[LexDAO](https://lexdao.net) is the industry's leading legal impact DAO.

No matter which sector of blockchain you're building in, that sector is guaranteed to be impacted by law in some way.

We're striving to build a world where decentralized organizations can comply with and thrive within the law.

That‚Äôs why Impact DAO Media considers us [an enabler DAO](https://cryptogood.substack.com/p/explained-the-top-5-impact-dao-categories), alongside Gitcoin: 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy-3gvOnn.png)

Our mission is to promote legal engineering as a profession by directly participating in endeavors such as blockchain advocacy, smart contract development, and education.

Legal engineering is the application of computational law in daily decentralized life. This includes things like lowering legal costs through smart contracts and open source ethics.

Legal engineering is also the study and practice of advocating for equitable integration of computational law within applied jurisprudence as a whole.

We at LexDAO firmly believe **open source legal engineering** is crucial infrastructure for a free and fair society in our digital age. 

It‚Äôs critically important that we as a community continue to support open-source organizations like LexDAO if we want to truly build a future where the law is accessible to and auditable by all.

# our ask

Despite our impact and low operational costs, LexDAO remains substantially underfunded.

As such, a donation of any amount makes a huge difference!

Our groundbreaking protocol seamlessly integrates inventive tokenomics and advanced cross-chain functionality into a single, powerful package. By incorporating a unique, game theory-based incentive model that actively rewards engagement, Xenify is primed to instigate a seismic shift in the world of cross-chain swapping. Our mission is clear: revolutionise the DeFi landscape by offering the best of both worlds: an ultra-efficient cross-chain swap experience and substantial opportunities for earning.

At the core of Xenify's bold vision is a cutting-edge liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. Whether you want to swap tokens on Arbitrum, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, or any of the 54 supported chains, Xenify has you covered. With access to 60 different aggregators, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for your swaps. By leveraging cutting-edge APIs, Xenify bridges seamless communication with a wide array of DEX aggregators, dramatically enhancing the swapping experience and streamlining the quest for optimal swap routes across the vast tapestry of chains.

What sets Xenify apart from other cross-chain swapping platforms is our commitment to cultivating an ecosystem where all participants prosper collectively. By contributing to swap fees across the supported EVM chains, users earn XNF tokens. Meanwhile, the accrued fees are redistributed as rewards to veXNF stakeholders and redeployed into fueling Xenify's growth. Furthermore, Xenify serves as a strategic layer 1 burner for XEN, enabling seamless conversion for XEN holders to participate in the burn auctions. At the conclusion of each burn auction cycle, our unique fee-utilisation algorithm directs burn fees not just as rewards to veXNF holders, but also fuel the continuous growth of Xenify through protocol-owned liquidity on Uniswap V3.

This win-win approach guarantees the perpetual proliferation of XNF liquidity, irrespective of market conditions, while also enhancing rewards for dedicated participants within the Xenify ecosystem. Through these aligned incentives that capture value for all participants, Xenify cultivates a thriving ecosystem for the long term. Moreover, at the heart of Xenify's ethos is a steadfast commitment to fairness and transparency, embodied by our exemplary token distribution model. With a maximum total supply of only 22,600,000 XNF tokens, there will be no allocation for the team, founders, or investors. In fact, the only way to acquire XNF tokens is through active participation in the ecosystem. This approach ensures a truly equitable distribution of XNF tokens, rewarding users for their contributions and fostering a community-driven protocol.

As we bring together our cutting-edge liquidity aggregation and distinctive tokenomics, Xenify is poised to redefine the landscape of cross-chain swapping, all while nurturing a thriving ecosystem that places utmost importance on user satisfaction and sustainable growth.

Farmly Finance allows users to engage in leveraged yield farming on Uniswap V3. Lenders can generate safe and stable returns while borrowers can create high yielding positions by borrowing against collateral through Farmly Finance. Borrowers determine the liquidity price range for their positions.

## What opportunities does Farmly Finance provide?

- Lending
- Leveraged Yield Farming

### What is Lending?

Lending enables individuals to lend their assets and earn interest. Through this, borrowers can access funds that can be borrowed to engage in leveraged yield farming.

### What is Yield Farming?

Yield farming is an innovative DeFi concept where users stake or lend their crypto assets to earn yields.

### What is Leveraged Yield Farming?

Leveraged Yield Farming sounds complicated, but it's simple. If you invest a certain amount of money, you will receive a corresponding return. If you invest five times that amount, your return will be five times as much. Keep in mind that the level of risk you take on will increase in proportion to your investment. Additionally, you must pay interest on the funds you borrow from lenders. The great feature of the app is that you can trade with funds that are five times the amount you invest.

You are completely free to open a leveraged position on Uniswap via Farmly Finance. You can choose in which price range you want to open a position. You can choose how much you want to borrow from which asset.

#### *Current status of Farmly Finance*

Farmly Finance is currently under development but has made great progress. Farmly Finance is currently developed on Uniswap V3. Uniswap V4 was announced while we were developing, but the team is working on Uniswap V4 integration. We are also working on tools and features to improve the leveraged yield farming experience.

We have also recently partnered with JPYC to enable businesses to off-ramp the crypto revenue into JPYC without having to manage wallets or digital assets at all. We aim to create a market environment that makes it easy for Japanese companies to receive crypto as a form of payment.

Merchant onboarding is super simple, without any KYC required. Dapps and EC sites can use our API by simply logging in with their crypto wallet, selecting the sales receipt settings from four types of stable coins, and issuing a contract.

Neutra Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that aims to offer risk-hedge, sustainable investment strategies through automated strategy vaults. We recognize the opportunities and risks of yield farming in the DeFi space, and our goal is to provide a way for users to make extra profits on their crypto holdings while reducing the risks from market price fluctuations.

Our mission is to make advanced investment strategies, which are typically complex and difficult to execute, accessible to a broader audience. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to farm yield on their idle assets without being overly affected by market volatility. To achieve this, Neutra Finance has developed automated vaults where users can deposit their capital into our vaults and earn an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that is above market standards, without the need to actively manage their investments.

**We are committed to three core values:**

1. **Performance:** We offer high-yield, sustainable strategies that minimize risk while optimizing returns for our users.
2. **Security:** We prioritize the security of funds by focusing on robust smart contract practices and rebalancing mechanisms to manage liquidation risks effectively.
3. **User Experience:** We strive to deliver our strategies in an intuitive and user-friendly manner, lowering the barrier to entry for general crypto investors and making it simple for anyone to participate.

Our vision is to enable users from all backgrounds to easily and sustainably earn high returns without the need to personally manage the risks involved.

## Project Overview

The Vanna Labs team is developing blockchain infrastructure to run AI/ML inference trustlessly and natively on-chain. 

Our goals for UAGP are four-fold:
1. Integrate Vanna‚Äôs trustless AI/ML inference features into an Arbitrum Orbit chain to bring the power of inference to the Arbitrum ecosystem. 
   - We want to make it super easy for developers on Arbitrum to develop intelligent applications that use AI models directly from their smart contracts powered by Vanna. 
2. Research and integrate AI models that quote dynamic fees into Uniswap V4 hooks to provably reduce impermanent loss for liquidity providers on Uniswap (Arbitrum).
3. Provide a sandbox ecosystem to allow developers to research and develop their own AI/ML-driven hooks for Uniswap V4.
4. Drive research and exploration for using AI/ML intelligent compute to benefit Uniswap (in addition to dynamic fees), this may include:
   - Using market regime models (like Hidden Markov Models) to vary fees in different market environments
   - Building AI/ML models to measure average toxicity of users‚Äô trades as a way to vary fees using a Uniswap hook.
   - Exploring collaboration with Spectral Finance to incorporate AI-generated credit scores to reduce fees with a Uniswap hook.
   - Creating ONNX models for pricing derivatives of tokens on Uniswap.

## Vanna Information

*Vanna Labs is building blockchain infrastructure to support trustless native AI/ML inference directly computed, secured, and verified on-chain; all designed in a way that is so seamless that leveraging AI/ML in dApps is as easy as a simple function call.*

**Vanna Blockchain**:

We currently have experimented with a blockchain testnet (currently used internally for testing and experimentation):
- RPC Endpoint: [http://dev-rpc.vannalabs.ai:9545](http://dev-rpc.vannalabs.ai:9545)
- Explorer url: [http://dev-rpc.vannalabs.ai:4000](http://dev-rpc.vannalabs.ai:4000)
- ChainID: 901
- Faucet: [https://vanna-faucet.vercel.app/](https://vanna-faucet.vercel.app/)

Vanna is building an Arbitrum Orbit Chain and bring the power of trustless AI and ML inference to the Arbitrum ecosystem, and we‚Äôre super excited to start with tackling use-cases we‚Äôve already researched for Uniswap‚Äôs AMMs.

Vanna is a blockchain network that settles on Arbitrum, and will be able to utilize cross-chain messages to communicate with Uniswap on Arbitrum via ArbOS precompiles. The ArbOS precompiles are able to thus, expose the inference results compute on Vanna to the Uniswap contracts on Ethereum to adjust the fees dynamically within the AMM pools.

[Here is a demo of our testnet running an on-chain fee calculation model.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cRb3HNAH88VSRqKRlgwKyNJvdmB3Uaj5/view?usp=sharing)

**Vanna's AMM Experimentation**:

In quant finance, market-makers typically increase the spreads and widen their quotes during periods of elevated volatility or risk. This makes sense because market makers want to be compensated more for taking on more risk.

However, this mechanism doesn‚Äôt really exist in DeFi AMMs yet, but one can imagine a similar mechanism through dynamically adjusting fees for AMM pools depending on the market regime. Uniswap put ‚Äú[dynamic fees based on volatility](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4)‚Äù as a key feature they‚Äôd like to see implemented via hooks in Uniswap V4.

But why are dynamic fees important? Dynamic fees are important because in periods of high volatility, impermanent loss risk is elevated and opportunistic traders are able to profit by arbitraging the pool and rebalancing the ratio of the assets in the pool; by dynamically increasing fees charged by the AMM pool during these periods of elevated risk, we are able to deter arbitrage activity and/or compensate liquidity providers more (with higher fees) for taking on high-risk order flow. Arbitrageurs are a net harm to an AMM because when they profit, it incurs impermanent loss on the liquidity providers of the AMM pool.  

![Dynamic Fees](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*GZgFveapPG23BGUrOCW5Nw.jpeg)

Needless to say, impermanent loss is one of the biggest pain-points of AMMs. [A16z Research introduced the idea of exploitable LVR](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lvr-quantifying-the-cost-of-providing-liquidity-to-automated-market-makers/), suggesting a new metric for benchmarking the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of an AMM by quantifying the amount of net profit the AMM exposes to opportunistic arbitrageurs. There is also [published research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09192?ref=hackernoon.com) that shows that for [more than half of Uniswap V3 liquidity providers](https://hackernoon.com/half-of-uniswap-v3-users-lose-money-heres-why), they lose more money via impermanent loss than they profit from fees.

![Impermanent Loss](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*auvql7rBAWRski5z.png)

Vanna enables native (on-chain) and trustless (zkML-secured) AI/ML inference, so we want to work with Uniswap to create a V4 hook on Arbitrum that uses price volatility to feed into an ML model on Vanna to trustlessly compute dynamic fees for Uniswap AMM pools. 

We‚Äôve already built a sample proof-of-concept regression model that we have running on the Vanna testnet that computes dynamic spreads; *however*, there is still a significant amount of room for improvement. In order to develop an effective model, we need to undergo significantly more thorough research, testing, and iterative model development; and we have planned to do as such as part of UAGP.

For the experiment model, we obtained orderbook data from the Kraken exchange and trained the model to quote like centralized market-makers. The model regresses different windows of price volatility on the top-of-the-book spread quoted by market-makers on Kraken. In other words, it uses moving-window volatility to predict spreads.

We then ran a simulation and modeled traders as purely opportunistic, in order to benchmark the performance of our spread calculation model. Note that the simulation time period is quite short, and only meant for demonstration purposes, we plan to create a more robust simulation platform as part of UAGP. The green line represents the ETH-USDT price while the red represents the volatility, which is the rolling standard deviation of the price.

![Simulation](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*S58TUXZGuoZlkto0bgrS7w.png)

As one can see from the results below, in this simulation, we are able to see the difference in liquidity provider balance increase over time (red: difference between dynamic fee model vs static fee model), especially when the exploitable LVR opportunity (represented as blue bars) was high. Empirically one can observe the dynamic fees protect user liquidity through charging higher fees to arbitrageurs during periods of elevated volatility.

![Results](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*cltuyKc3OmiBXZ84F0j_jg.png)

The key lies in reducing the net instantaneous exploitable LVR during periods of high volatility by increasing fees

The experiment was part of a hackathon project the Vanna team had worked on, [codebase linked here](https://github.com/jeff0723/VannaSwap).

## Arbitrum Ecosystem Impact 

*Vanna aims to bring trustless AI/ML to the Arbitrum ecosystem by building an Arbitrum Orbit Chain that can run inference. This would allow for developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem to use Vanna‚Äôs infrastructure to leverage sophisticated models in a way that is trustless, secure, and scalable to build sophisticated dApps that are more intelligent.*

![AI Use-Cases](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*KQNIQ5ZZIs2trWyyvg1v_A.png)

**Nerd-sniping for Arbitrum**:

Vanna opens entirely new verticals for nerd-sniping more engineers and researchers into the Arbitrum ecosystem to develop applications on Arbitrum with Vanna‚Äôs infrastructure as an orbit chain. Here I highlight multiple new areas of development that Vanna creates for the collective and can get engineers and researchers alike excited!

1. Quantitative Research in DeFi 
   - With secure on-chain inference, we can leverage machine learning to enable sophisticated features within DeFi! Opens the door to quantitative research talent from quant funds like Two Sigma, Jane Street, Citadel‚Ä¶etc.

## Uniswap Ecosystem Impact

*Vanna plans to use machine learning models secured by zkML to intelligently compute dynamic fees for Uniswap pools using V4 hooks to reduce net impermanent loss for liquidity providers (LPs). We also plan to explore various other use-cases of intelligent compute and how Vanna can be used to further improve the Uniswap user experience.*

![AMM Dynamic Fees](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*tPMzEZHd0fPaiKkyjp4_XQ.png)

From the simulation experiment we conducted above, we are able to see that there is a quantifiable benefit to dynamically varying fees for AMM pools by using a model to emulate how centralized market-makers quote on orderbook exchanges.

This model can prove to be extremely powerful for an AMM like Uniswap:
- **Liquidity Providers win** because they will suffer from less impermanent loss in the long run.
- **Regular traders win** because when folks trade normally most of the time they can actually benefit from lower fees.
- **Opportunistic arbitrageurs lose** because they make less net profit (due to higher fees) when they arb a pool. 

We wrote more about our experiment here, [this article](https://medium.com/vanna-labs/protecting-amm-liquidity-with-on-chain-machine-learning-5aa1af546528) contains high-level comments about our implementation and thoughts.

**Vanna x Uniswap Synergies**:

We want to create a positive sum game for Vanna x Uniswap, here are some benefits that we think Uniswap will benefit from for this partnership.

1. **Improving Uniswap (less LP impermanent loss)**
   - The most obvious benefit for Uniswap is that Vanna‚Äôs models can help improve the liquidity provision experience for LPs on Uniswap, by reducing the impermanent loss they suffer from via dynamic fees.

2. **Opening doors to AI on Uniswap**
   - The Vanna x Uniswap integration opens the doors to new quant research and ML engineering talent that may be interested in building sophisticated models to help improve the initial fee calculation model, or build out other sophisticated models to help build more features or solve other problems on Uniswap. Examples:
      - Systematic trading strategies 
      - AI-driven smart execution
      - Models to predict trade toxicity for varying trading fees
      - Using HMM market regime models to vary fees in different market environments
      - Incorporate AI-generated credit scores to vary fees
      - Creating models for pricing derivatives of tokens on Uniswap.

3. **Opening doors to new applications on Uniswap**
   - Kickstarting the Vanna x Uniswap integration will encourage more intelligent dApps to be developed on Uniswap in the future. AI driven vaults that use Uniswap for trading, ML driven risk management that uses Uniswap to de-risk or hedge portfolio exposure, ETFs that have smart rebalancing‚Ä¶etc.

4. **Tech-forward PR**
   - With AI and ML being increasingly popular and ubiquitous, having a progressive approach to integrating these technologies to improve the experience of users reflects well on the protocol team. It‚Äôs good to be a trailblazer in piloting new technology, demonstrating a forward-thinking culture.

We are building a protocol with automated and user-friendly liquid staking strategies.

Staking tokens is a key method for earning returns, but maximizing APYs through recursive staking and lending pools can be complex and daunting, especially for users unfamiliar with DeFi. 

On top of this, we have 4 main pillars as a solution:

- Our platform offers a user-friendly experience with seamless and intuitive liquid staking features;
- Users select an ETH amount, click 'Start Program', and our smart contract automates optimal return actions;
- The smart contract automates staking and redistribution of balances to prevent liquidations;
- Users staking receive brETH, a liquid token, tradable and usable for any purpose, with daily reward payouts.


Our target market includes the usual DeFi-savvy people and people with less knowledge like regular users. We think the market needs a solution simple enough to incentivize anyone to be a part of the DeFi world.

The decentralised web promises a future that's more open, private, and resilient. However, a significant barrier exists: compatibility with current infrastructure. Most of today's browsers are not equipped to interface with web3 technologies, including Arbitrum Name Service (.arb) records and IPFS content. ARB Gateway, through our domain arb.qa, aims to bridge this divide, acting as a bridge between the centralized and decentralized worlds.

**Objective:**

1. Enable seamless resolution of .arb domains and associated IPFS content.
2. Bring web3 content to mainstream users without requiring them to modify their existing browsing habits.

**How it works:**

- **Reverse Proxy Operation:** arb.qa will function as a reverse proxy for ARB names and IPFS content.
- **Dynamic DNS Capture:** Leveraging a wildcard DNS record, arb.qa will dynamically capture all .arb domain requests.
- **Automatic Resolution:** Upon receiving a request, arb.qa will immediately determine the IPFS contenthash of the demanded .arb record and promptly deliver the related static content over HTTPS.

**The Need:**

- **Inadequate Web2 Infrastructure:** The prevalent web2 infrastructure falls short in accommodating the burgeoning web3 ecosystem.
- **Limited Browser Support:** A majority of browsers today cannot natively access .arb/IPFS.
- **Infrastructure Void:** No established gateway infrastructure exists for .arb domains.

**Funding Request:**
We are seeking funding to:

1. Scale our infrastructure to handle the increasing demand.
2. Develop user-friendly tools to assist developers in integrating .arb into their projects.
3. Launch educational initiatives, ensuring more users and developers understand the potential and utility of .arb/IPFS and web3 content.
4. Improve the robustness of our systems, ensuring high availability and uptime.

**Conclusion:**

The decentralised web promises a future that's more open, private, and resilient. However, a significant barrier exists: compatibility with current infrastructure. Most of today's browsers are not equipped to interface with web3 technologies, including Binance Name Service (.bnb) records and IPFS content. BNB Gateway, through our domain bnb.qa, aims to bridge this divide, acting as a bridge between the centralized and decentralized worlds.

**Objective:**

1. Enable seamless resolution of .bnb domains and associated IPFS content.
2. Bring web3 content to mainstream users without requiring them to modify their existing browsing habits.

**How it works:**

- **Reverse Proxy Operation:** bnb.qa will function as a reverse proxy for BNB names and IPFS content.
- **Dynamic DNS Capture:** Leveraging a wildcard DNS record, bnb.qa will dynamically capture all .bnb domain requests.
- **Automatic Resolution:** Upon receiving a request, bnb.qa will immediately determine the IPFS contenthash of the demanded .bnb record and promptly deliver the related static content over HTTPS.

**The Need:**

- **Inadequate Web2 Infrastructure:** The prevalent web2 infrastructure falls short in accommodating the burgeoning web3 ecosystem.
- **Limited Browser Support:** A majority of browsers today cannot natively access .bnb/IPFS.
- **Infrastructure Void:** No established gateway infrastructure exists for .bnb domains.

**Funding Request:**
We are seeking funding to:

1. Scale our infrastructure to handle the increasing demand.
2. Develop user-friendly tools to assist developers in integrating .bnb into their projects.
3. Launch educational initiatives, ensuring more users and developers understand the potential and utility of .bnb/IPFS and web3 content.
4. Improve the robustness of our systems, ensuring high availability and uptime.

## Sustainability {GHGs)
Decentralized library, focused on sustainability and environmentally conscious content, can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in several ways:

- Reduction of Physical Resources: Traditional libraries often require large amounts of paper, ink, and other physical resources to produce and distribute printed books and materials. By promoting digital resources and e-books, a decentralized library can significantly reduce the demand for these resources, resulting in fewer emissions associated with their production and transportation.
- Energy Efficiency: Centralized data centers and physical libraries require substantial energy for heating, cooling, and maintaining the infrastructure. Decentralized libraries, powered by blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, can potentially operate with lower energy consumption, especially if the network uses renewable energy sources.
- Minimized Transportation: Traditional library systems involve the distribution of physical books to various locations. This transportation contributes to GHG emissions due to the use of fossil fuels in the delivery process. A decentralized library eliminates the need for physical transportation, reducing emissions associated with the shipping of books and resources.
- Reduced Deforestation: Decentralized libraries can discourage deforestation by advocating for the use of digital content rather than paper-based resources. Reduced demand for paper products can help protect forests and reduce the carbon emissions associated with deforestation.
- Remote Access: By providing users with easy access to digital resources from anywhere in the world, a decentralized library can reduce the need for individuals to travel to physical libraries. Fewer trips to library locations mean fewer emissions from transportation.
- Environmental Education: Decentralized libraries can curate content on environmental sustainability, climate change, and green technologies. By providing access to these resources, they can help educate the public about climate issues and inspire action to reduce GHG emissions.
- Blockchain for Carbon Offsetting: Some blockchain projects and cryptocurrencies are exploring ways to support carbon offsetting initiatives. A decentralized library could potentially integrate with such initiatives to facilitate carbon offset donations or rewards for users engaged in sustainable practices.
- Support for Green Initiatives: A decentralized library can serve as a platform for sharing information about local and global green initiatives and sustainability projects. It can connect users with resources on renewable energy, eco-friendly practices, and climate change mitigation efforts.
- Peer-to-Peer Sharing: Decentralized libraries can encourage users to share resources with their peers, reducing the need to purchase new books or access new digital content. Sharing and peer-to-peer exchange can help minimize resource consumption and reduce the carbon footprint of producing new materials.
- Data Security and Privacy: Ensuring data security and privacy can reduce the likelihood of data breaches or cyberattacks that could result in energy-intensive data recovery and restoration processes, thus minimizing associated GHG emissions.

## Summary
In summary, a decentralized library that emphasizes sustainability and digital resources can help reduce GHG emissions by minimizing the demand for physical resources, decreasing energy consumption, reducing transportation-related emissions, and fostering environmental education and awareness. Such a library can play a valuable role in supporting global efforts to combat climate change and promote a more sustainable future.",https://decentralized-library.vercel.app/,bafkreiax7v46geo5lvrdgz3zokbu4fd4xjhklmkf5j5zibm2zteok4q4iy,bafkreieq5736c4eo55k4ffawoxtn3kixlb277vp7tjp7upcfrcy6tf6ssi,holyaustin,NA,holyaustin,bafkreign5rb37ahtsmazuwvh5rljvqwxgj2uxta4f5vhl32io6luiku5na

Background

Well I‚Äôm CryptoReuMD (Cryptoreumd.eth),medical doctor with a  Rheumatology specialist, with knowledge in statics and critical scientific papers evaluation. 
I‚Äôm inside crypto because i believe that we need not only a P2P payment system, also to make our friends and family sovereign and take control of their content, decisions and universe around them, crypto makes us more humans, to stay away from things that can be overwhelming or problematic, jumping into confidence and coordinations we can keep away any problem inside the traps of Moloch and failure of coordination. 

I've been the champion for Naci√≥n Bankless since June 2022, and I have been working since november 2021, so i have, i think, some knowledge about coordination process, DAO governance and great decision making. I‚Äôve started my journey with my own channel, walking through the projects that i believed that were relevant and incredible, also i was helping Espacio Cripto as a content moderator, content creator and community builder, when i organized twitter spaces about Layer 2, with all my effort being around adoption Arbitrum, meanwhile we found the Ethereum Mexico project, a community driven by the ethereum ecosystem, where i was talking about projects, layer 2, and the coordination process of governance and how this is important.

Actually as champion of Nacion Bankless, I'm coordinating the DAO, relations, evaluation, coaching and quality monitoring. I am very committed and dedicated, I seek to help everyone, no matter how difficult or far-fetched the desire may be. We are a project of fourteen people that it‚Äôs around the world and are native hispanic speakers and some bilingual but we are intended to create content and help the people become Bankless. I‚Äôve been aware of campaigns for Bankless Academy, BanklessDAO, Gitcoin, Meta Pool, Push, and now I'm very active in the governance process. 

Rationale

Arbitrum was my first Layer 2, where I've started to discover how I can bridge and how I can use all the ecosystem. I'm an early user, well that‚Äôs what i think, since may 2022, i was on boarding people to use Arbitrum as their first layer 2. and then in Ethereum Mexico I was one of the hostesses of the Mexican community in the Road to Devcon.

Since I'm in charge of the BanklessDAO community in Spanish I've also been doing some work to understand how layer 2 helps the people and try to understand how this process becomes real everyday. 
For this reason I have taken the enterprise of helping people understand ReFi, Public Goods, onChain Gaming, DAO and the importance of voting power and the fungibility and price of a digital asset.

My mission

My mission with Arbitrum has been a difficult road because I have tried to cooperate, and have different opportunities to talk more about the ecosystem, with grants, talks and even from a questbook and we have always been rejected. 

If there is one thing I can be sure of it is that I love the ecosystem but honestly I have been sad about the decisions and changes that exist in relation to governance and decision making. But this time with this round of funding has brought me back to happiness and I hope to have a chance to make my community shine and continue to participate in this life project that is decentralization and human coordination. 

My vision

I'm fully committed to public goods, science and coordination. All of my different approaches in the ecosystem it‚Äôs just to give and help. As a doctor, it‚Äôs my natural point of view, always helping people to make their lives better. I think this is an excellent opportunity. Since my early years I've been looking inside the eyes of people that it‚Äôs sick and don't have the means to heal and also to buy their medicines, so this enterprise, this journey it‚Äôs to give tools to the people to own their finances and to give what I'm building. 

Also another direction of this initiative it‚Äôs looking at the DeSci project, which is also part of the roadmap. I think that medicine needs the knowledge of everything, and as a medical doctor I‚Äôm battling the misunderstood health policy and social systems, and the vast majority of our patients don't have medicines, health treatments or even food. So i‚Äôm choosing as my direction to continue helping people and constitute a decentralized medical journal.

Talking about Arbitrum for Nacion Bankless

1.- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6ql_ok0B8
As you all know being a leader of a project that focuses on governance and education as a public good is complicated and making proposals for projects takes hours and hours of review, updating, even some stress and frustration, so I share with you that I have made several proposals to the governance of arbitration that have been rejected, I do not do it with the find of evidence the decisions, but with the fact that it has taken me at least 30-40 hours of my life to write, review, and pitch one of  each proposal.

The Superbridge recently went live with support for Arbitrum Nitro powered chains - Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to start, with more L2's and L3's launching soon.

With the Arbitrum Nitro launch we teamed up with Conduit (https://conduit.xyz) to give all testnet and devnet deployments a free instance of the Superbridge. The Superbridge instance can be launched from within the Conduit interface and requires no approval from our side.

In addition to ETH and ERC20 token bridging, chains powered by Arbitrum Nitro have access to easy mode withdrawals. Easy mode withdrawals allow us (Superbridge operators) to handle relaying the withdrawal transactions on the base chain after the seven day fraud proof period has elapsed.

## Awareness & Education - Spreading ArbitrumDAO Activities
In addition to my forum contributions, I have been actively involved in raising awareness and educating the community about ArbitrumDAO activities. I have organized and conducted community workshops within the Public Good Africa telegram group to facilitate knowledge sharing and help community members and projects understand Arbitrum and its DAO activities. The primary objectives of these workshops were to:

### Drive Global Participation: 
My aim was to encourage broader participation in the ArbitrumDAO, particularly from regions with untapped potential, such as Africa. By conducting workshops, I sought to make the ecosystem more inclusive and accessible to participants worldwide.

### Empowering Projects to participate in DAO initiatives such as Grants programs: 
I offered support to projects interested in engaging with the Arbitrum ecosystem, especially those looking to participate in Grant programs sponsored by the DAO through workshops in the Public Good Africa telegram. These workshops acted as a valuable resource, guiding projects to the right information and processes. 

### Driving participation in Arbitrum Grants on Gitcoin
I have also been vocal in helping people understand the impact of grants run on Gitcoin and how they have the power to help allocate fund to the right projects. I have advocated and continue to advocate for donors to partake in the arbitrum grants rounds. 


My contributions to the ArbitrumDAO have encompassed active forum engagement, proposals for enhanced community communication, and educational initiatives aimed at expanding the ecosystem's reach and empowering projects to be part of this experiment. I am committed to continuing my efforts to promote ArbitrumDAO's growth and accessibility, and I am excited about the potential we can unlock together. Your support will enable me to make an even greater impact on the Arbitrum community and its mission.

For over a year (Since June 2022), I've raised student developers in Africa who build on Arbitrum.

One of our Success Stories is Favour Ekekleme who recently became Arbitrum Ambassador in the University of Port-Harcourt.

He joined the B<>rder/ess developers program in November 2022 and has since become familiar with Solidity and the Arbitrum ecosystem so much so that he is now an ambassador.

You can check him out here
https://twitter.com/ekelemefavour1


I already have a network of University Student Developers in Nigeria who we're raising to build with Solidity, Pyteal, and much more.

I've raised devs to build on the Arbitrum using solidity, to our developer training curriculum

I've also raised Crypto enthusiasts who understand how to trade the DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum, using wallets, Metamask, and more.

Overall, some of our training activities include:

1. Using Arbitrum - Community Activities

2. Building on Arbitrum - Developer Activities

3. Bridging in and out of the Arbitrum Network

4. dApp ideas that support Arbitrum Network


My work with my Not-for-profit's last Cipher Session Started in October and we had 20 new developers signed up to take our free Solidity course.

See our Progress Report here:
https://x.com/cryptosmartnow/status/1707740083451723815?s=20


These programs cover a wide range of topics, including:

1. Web design & development
2. Blockchain development
3. Data science
4. Cyber Security
5. AI and robotics
6. UI/UX design
7. Product Management
8. 3D Animations, Unreal Engine

and a lot of others.


Mentorship: I pair developers with experienced mentors. These mentors provide guidance and support to help developers reach their full potential.

1) I am a member of Castle Capital, an Arbitrum native community that has been contributing to research on Arbitrum and governance.
I have contributed as an analyst in investigating the sustainability of proposals for the STIP grants.

With this efforts, we have contributed to provide context and clarity in the interests of other delegates which had to analyze 100+ proposals, as well as contributing with our on-chain native perspective to the discussion.

We have also created free and public tools that simplified and summarized the proposals.

The values driving our STIP votes:

we digest the hard to understand tech side, and explain on simple ways, how it works, and how it can easily help them in different activities, from their basic social media apps all the way to their financial activities, and not just users, but builders as well, we have been covering technical topics already that no other person or entity is covering in Spanish, like for example celestia, data sampling and how arbitrum orbit leverages this.

We are doing all this out of pure heart and self funding, to aid in the ecosistem growth and the adoption of the masses, with the help of the DAO we can take this to a whole new level of education and quality content creation that will create an even bigger impact!

This will allow us to put more and better content out there, and also in different formats, to target different audiences, wuill help to grow the team

we have generated more than 30k views in the past 90 days alone, those are great numbers for a Spanish technical channel

I'm a newbie in the Arbitrum ecosystem, however in the last couple of weeks I have a few news I'd like to share.

I've got interested in Arbitrum thx to Disruption Joe's explanation of differences between Arbitrum and Optimism licencing models on X

## Contribution

1. I've passed the explanation to DeSpace QF community, and a lot of members became interested 

2. I've shilled the idea of launching[ DeSpace round on Arbitrum, and now we have it! ](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688)
**At least 14 Decentralized Space Exploration projects on Arbitrum!**
BTW You can help get more projects by donating to projects on the round

[Projects on DeSpace QF round can LITERALLY BRING ARBITRUM TO THE MOON!](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x911ae126be7d88155aa9254c91a49f4d85b83688)

3. I've personally onboarded ~5 projects, helping them to bridge money, set the project and so on, lot of them created projects on Arbitrum

## Bio

I've joined Gitcoin with my project LunCo on the last days of the GR14, thou my first real round was GR15/DeSci.

Since that I've being promoting Gitcoin, QF, and ReFi among space professionals. 

I've worked on the walking rover for the Moon that  has to be launched on the Peregrine Lander.

[![Asagumo The First Walking Rover](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F6s1XAtagAAxA12?format=png&name=small)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fko0VZNO8DM)

I'm a huge fan of OSS (FYI I'm using Linux)

I believe that Space Exploration must be democratized and Gitcoin and related activities are the first real opportunity to do that!

Hi my name is Medocons. I've been doing Crypto since 2016, Defi since 2020. I am active member of Czech and Slovak crypto community BitCoach and minor investor with syndicate Angels Squad DAO. Besides classic trading I'm trying to improve my knowledge about cryptocurrencies and gradually search for innovative projects on innovative protocols. I consider Arbitrum to be the best protocol within the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem, as evidenced by the fact that I have executed the most significant amount of my trades within Arbitrum. At the same time, I perceive that Arbitrum Foundation is a leader in introducing innovations to the crypto world, whether it is the way Arbitrum Foundation approaches decentralization, the way Arbitrum DAO works, or the way grants are allocated. I also perceive that Arbitrum provides a space for innovative projects to grow and develop. Since the creation of the Arbitrum DAO, my activities have evolved from delegating my ARBs to delegates to taking on the role of a delegate myself and voting in individual votes. 

Project description
Since I am not an expert-level developer or an experienced founder I decided to help the Arbitrum ecosystem by creating promo videos, the creation of which is one of my hobbies. In addition to videos dedicated to Arbitrum, I have focused on creating videos dedicated to smaller innovative projects where I see a lot of potential for growth. An example of such a projects are HMX and Good Entry, for which I have produced several videos as a volunteer community member. The aim of my videos is to proactively support the work of the Arbitrum DAO, especially in terms of raising the visibility of Arbitrum, the Arbitrum Foundation, the Arbitrum DAO and the activities carried out by the Arbitrum DAO or projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The videos in my project are divided into 2 groups. The first group includes videos for Arbitrum itself, the Arbitrum DAO and the Arbitrum Foundation and includes videos made in March 2023 and later. The second group contains videos for projects that were created in March 2023 and later and are protocols that are active exclusively within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Although these videos are focused on innovative protocols, they always include an important mention of Arbitrum. All these videos were prepared on a voluntary basis without any fee. 

The videos were posted on Discord, Twitter or Telegram. For the purposes of better accessibility within this project, I have posted them in one place on Instagram.",https://www.instagram.com/medocons_arbitrum/,bafkreig4pdcz7i43ggmlt2oojsed5ziecf6bny22p6r4dgqyevkmet2cvi,bafkreigpwsuwtblfajyyjrnb2zllmi564jyrzstskwy3t55kdf3rsllkzq,medocons,medocons2023,medocons,bafkreig2zuot4vyzsl25mjayzp6brvt27hofebbkptjq6ca7qmontw2p7a

The STIP will yield a large amount of data that should be used to inform future programs of how to most effectively create incentives for projects on Arbitrum. This is a first step in collecting that information and assessing what methods are the most effective incetive structures to driving value for Arbitrum.

Work Done to Date:
- Creation of scope and subsequent RFP for teams to apply through discussions with the STIP Data working group and collaboration with @tnorm and @epowell101
- Forum moderation and discussion with teams to determine application offer completeness
- Assessment of 7 project applications and final decision making with other Plurality Labs contributors.
- Review of successful team preliminary deliverables (on-going)

Impact to DAO / community
- 7 proposals submitted by teams in response to the RFP
- Successful onboarding of Data Monitoring and Reporting SP (OpenBlock Labs)
- Full impact is reliant on ongoing deliverables by the SP and how this data is interrogated. The real value is ahead of the DAO and there is work yet to be done!

This helps fund the Arbitrum DAO and ecosystems' public goods projects and contributors. 

This cohort was designed to help people learn how to be a Round Manager on Gitcoin‚Äôs Grant Stack, including on Arbitrum. We also have current students who are specifically learning to run rounds for the Arbitrum ecosystem. 

This supports the DAO's goal of a sustainable and decentralized ecosystem by providing people with the tools, training, knowledge, and skills needed to help fund the ecosystem in a holistic and fair way. 

It's an 8-week cohort and includes live weekly training sessions, drop-in office hours, a private discord channel, funds to run a sprint QF round, and ongoing support once the training ends. We currently have 48 trainees in this round and will run another starting Q1 2024. 

Our goal is to provide as many people as possible with the skills and resources needed to help run funding rounds for the Arbitrum DAO and communities within the Arbitrum ecosystem. 

The curriculum is as follows:

Module 1: Become a Public Goods Maxi
Module 2: QF and QV 101 
Module 3: Create a QF round
Module 4: Grantee Recruitment and Onboarding
Module 5. During the Round Marketing
Module 6. Post Round Analysis
Module 7: Fundraising 
Module 8: Growing your program

I have been an active contributor to the Arbitrum DAO for the past 6+ months. Not all of the work I have been doing has been done in full view of the public, but my overall goal has been to find sustainable solutions for Arbitrum's on-chain liquidity environment, both for projects building on Arbitrum as well as for the $ARB token itself.

The research I have conducted led to the publishing of a 25+ page proposal by SushiSwap that was posted to the forums. Since then I have been actively involved in dozens of conversations with leading delegates and working groups about treasury diversification, on-chain liquidity acquisition, sustainable emissions, etc.

IMPACT REPORT

1. I've set up Borderless tech clubs in 6 Universities where University Students are trained to build with Solidity.

2. The clubs teach non-dev members and dev members on how to interact with Arbitrum Ecosystem,  bridge, contribute, do DeFi activities and more.

3. Take in web2 Dev interns, and teach them about web3 and how they could transition and provide value in the web3 ecosystem.

One of such product of our intern program is Pluto Dev, Favour Ekeleme who is now the Arbitrum Ambassador in the University of Port-Harcourt.

You can check him out here.

I played a pivotal role, albeit behind the scenes, in advocating for the redirection of the Arbitrum token's focus towards establishing more decentralized liquidity.

My contributions included the development of several models aimed at simulating potential solutions to the liquidity challenges, supported by concrete evidence. Additionally, I formulated a long-term strategy geared towards sustainability.

I've offered guidance to the Treasury Diversification and Sustainability Working Group (comprising Devanche and Sadik) in their budget analysis.

# Who are we ?

Cosmos for Humanity | C4H is a Swiss NGO based in Neuch√¢tel whose mission is to promote the sustainable development of space activities and to act to preserve the orbital environment.

# What‚Äôs the problem ?

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/q6EbElt.gif)

Faced with the challenges posed by the increasing congestion of our planet's useful orbits, current approaches to space sustainability tend to be aimed solely at industry and specialised public agencies. However, citizens and companies outside the space sector are also [extremely dependent on satellite capabilities](https://www.ted.com/talks/moriba_jah_what_if_every_satellite_suddenly_disappeared?language=en) to maintain their social, economic, political and environmental activities. How can we help them become aware of the consequences of orbital pollution, and give them the means to defend their own interests in outer space?

-----------------------------

# Turning citizens and companies into ‚ÄúNew Space‚Äù stakeholders

C4H's approach responds to the challenges of space debris by empowering citizens and companies outside the space sector. Considering that we all have the right to benefit from Earth‚Äôs Orbit, as much as the duty, in maintaining environmentally and economically sustainable access to space. 
> **If we all consume satellite data, then we are all responsible for preserving the orbital environment.**
As part of a partnership with the French Space Agency ([CNES](https://cnes.fr/en)), Cosmos for Humanity has conceptualised an indicator, the Outer Space Footprint (OSF). Like the energy performance indicator, the OSF gives citizens and businesses the opportunity to defend their interests in space by encouraging or sanctioning the behaviour of space operators and their customers through their choice of consumption and suppliers.
![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/Nmm7Jvj/OSF-3.jpg)

C4H proposes that the OSF be adopted as the European Standard for Space Sustainability and that its display be made mandatory for all products and services directly or indirectly related to space. C4H is also campaigning for the preservation of Earth's orbits to be recognised as the 7th Environmental Objective of the [European Green Taxonomy](https://www.spglobal.com/esg/insights/a-short-guide-to-the-eu-s-taxonomy-regulation) and for the obligation for European companies to document their environmental impact to be extended to their footprint on the orbital environment, under the [NFRD/CSRD directives](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en).

# Turning citizens into ‚ÄúNew Space‚Äù actors
As a complement to the OSF, C4H is running a collaborative label project designed to democratise the concept of space environmentalism. The aim is to enable as many people as possible to make a direct contribution to preserving our orbits by analysing and evaluating companies' policies on space sustainability. We intend to develop a label with a decentralised certification process that would reward citizens for collecting environmental data from companies, while giving them the power to decide on the award of the label.
This label is being developed as part of a technological partnership with a blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem so that the certification can be carried out in a transparent, independent, traceable, and unfalsifiable way.
This partnership will be officially launched during the GG19.

# Keep records of space pollution for the next generation
At the same time, as a form of digital immune memory, C4H will endeavour, to make all data relating to the OSF and the behaviour of operators in orbit immutable. Keeping track of this data will prove strategic over the next 50 years, in the event of saturation of Earth's orbits and snowballing instances of satellite collisions, described as [Kessler's Syndrome](https://www.space.com/kessler-syndrome-space-debris), C4H‚Äôs indicators empower citizens to hold companies liable  for their bad behaviours in outer space in the event of catastrophes that may arise. This legal sword of Damocles is a powerful lever for encouraging companies to adopt responsible policies in terms of space sustainability.

----------------------------
# Our missions in a nutshell :

1.	Develop the Outer Space Footprint (OSF) to evaluate the environmental impact of the use of satellite data on the whole value chain: from launchers and satellites operators to end-users, citizens and companies. 
2.	Create a citizen-led eco-label dedicated to studying the outer space environmental impact of companies. Our goal is to create a new way of looking at consumer labels, without the use of trusted third parties and in particular auditing firms [that have conflicts of interest with companies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/26/blue-ticked-off-the-controversy-over-the-msc-fish-ecolabel).
3.	Promote the incorporation of orbit protection as the 7th EU environmental objective so that OSF documentation is made mandatory for European companies (NFRD / CSRD directives) and that sustainable space activities are considered as ""sustainable activities"" in the sense of the European Green Taxonomy.
4.	Create educational content to make English-language studies on ""Space as a Commons"" accessible to French-, German- and Italian-speaking communities, in order to develop the ReFi x DeSpace community in Switzerland, France, Germany and Italy.
5.	Fund the development of an ecosystem dedicated to the sustainable development of space activities. Researchers and startups are currently struggling to find funding because space sustainability is not ""hype"" or ""profitable"" at the moment. We need to help them.
6.	Encourage other teams to fork our stack to see other sister labels emerge on the same model for ocean preservation, forest preservation, or simply to verify carbon footprint data provided by companies.

# Updates since GG18 & Beta Round :

‚Ä¢	We have published a contribution to the European Commission' survey about the [ecological transition of the European aerospace and defence industry](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/consultations/transition-pathway-resilient-sustainable-and-digital-aerospace-and-defence-industrial-ecosystem_en#target-audience).
‚Ä¢	We are participating in the European Commission's consultation on the future of [EU space legislation](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/public-consultations/targeted-consultation-eu-space-law_en). A very interesting fact for C4H: the EU is considering introducing a space label!
‚Ä¢	We applied to the [Space 4 Sustainability award](https://www.space-sustainability-award.com/about) of the European Space Agency (ESA). We didn't win, but we did have the opportunity to get feedback on OSF from ESA officials.
‚Ä¢	We have delivered the third part of our partnership with CNES concerning OSF. Our aim now is to convince the French space agency to promote OSF within the European Union.
‚Ä¢	We produced our first educational content in French, English, Italian, German and Russian on the sustainable development of space activities.
‚Ä¢	We participated in the French translation of GreenPilled, as part of GreenPill Afrique Francophone. The eBook is available [here !](https://greenpill.network/)
‚Ä¢	We had the opportunity to promote OSF at the ""Regen Ignite"" event during ETHCC in Paris at the invitation of Sparx Lab.

## [Download Dev Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)

The goal of LunCo is to integrate existing Space & Robotics industry models into one Virtual World, allowing collaborative (concurrent) engineering.

While focused on Space Engineering, it's not limited to it. With Godot as a 3D engine, it's **easy to add new functions and models, e.g. plan Solar Power Station parameters,** and concept of operations, e.g. how often to clean panels.

The below diagram highlights the overall idea.
![Multiuser](https://bafybeic5mnsajdsyrszy7ddnoy5uvxhz76usukcnatp5g5exqapqagzcc4.ipfs.w3s.link/Combining%20simulations.png)

LunCo is focused on **Data Sovereignty**, meaning that there is no need for central server. Users can run it locally, use it to edit their project, and then share it with the community using IP-NFTs for data discoverability, and decentralized data exchange networks like IPFS to share data itself.

[![Multiuser](https://bafybeibdidgnutcuhqodxkvnh3qpecugyu6a7p6rvk7w36jwe5m4mtotty.ipfs.w3s.link/Federated.png)](https://twitter.com/LunCoSim/status/1679031437780201472)

## Why Web3?

Web3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. 

The most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.

The core technology behind distributed time synchronization is heavily biased toward software development, with nearly all core hardware technology available commercially today. This proposal aims to use agent-based modeling and simulations to explore how centralized and decentralized PNT service network topologies evolve in a growing lunar ecosystem. Modeling network topologies representative of near-term lunar missions and large future populations of cislunar actors will predict the relative performance, ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù of assets required for service, and coverage of decentralized PNT services and/or GNSS-like beacons providing PNT to lunar missions. There is an abundance of prior art describing optimal orbit configurations for such systems that can also be evaluated in this way.

The model will feature a population of agents, where each agent has a Stratum, a location and velocity, a clock with drift, and a communications system with a spectral band and radiation power. Agents belong to one of three groups based on their behavior: Transmitters, Receivers, and Peers. Transmitter agents radiate signals but do not listen for incoming signals. Receivers listen for incoming signals but do not radiate. Peers are capable of listening for and radiating signals. Agents move in space independently along orbits or surface routes around a sphere in the simulation space representing the Moon. Terrestrial communications systems are modeled as a Stratum 0 Transmitter. Every node reports measurements of each metric described in the subsequent Metrics section at every step of the simulation period.

Over the simulation period, each agent‚Äôs clock encounters simulated drift that accumulates over time. The agents record their perceived position by integrating instantaneous velocity observations over time, where the observed time is based on the local clock‚Äôs epoch. At the end of the simulation period, the observed position is compared to the true position. Agents may interact with one another over the simulation period using modeled communications links for PNT measurements and time synchronization. Links are only established between two agents if both 1) share a common spectral band; 2) have line-of-sight to each other; 3) have sufficient radiation power to transmit across the distance between them; and 4) at least one agent is a Transmitter. When a link is established, the Receiver agent‚Äôs clock is synchronized to the Transmitter‚Äôs epoch. If both agents are Peers, the agents synchronize to the epoch of the agent with a lower Stratum, or the mean epoch between them. Each time an agent synchronizes to another agent, it becomes Stratum n+1 where Stratum n belongs to the agent with the lower number. Agent A syncs to UTC and becomes Stratum 1, then Agent B syncs to A and so Agent B becomes Stratum 2, and so on.

This model framework permits rapid simulation of heterogeneous nodes acting as PNT servers, clients, or both. The proposed study seeks to evaluate Wi-Wi based decentralized networks as alternatives to GNSS-like services for cislunar PNT. The described model allows each network topology to be tested and instrumented while subject to realistic client population densities in near-term (tens of agents) and future scenarios (hundreds, thousands of agents). The described model also permits the simulation of multiple PNT services coexisting,  such as Parsec, weak-GPS, and the proposed decentralized network. The model also accounts for the evolution of competing providers as the populations of servers and clients grow. 

Insights obtained from models will then be applied to create an optimal mission profile for a constellation of cislunar spacecraft equipped with space-rated Time Cards that enable the proposed capability of a publicly available minimum viable PNT service. With relevant prediction of cislunar PNT users for each PNT service configuration over the next 5 to 15 years, and also computing the equivalent cost per user for terrestrial GNSS, data-driven investment decisions related to deploying new PNT fleets in cislunar space are possible.

## Building Bridges between Web3 Ecosystems: Regenerative Finance, Decentralized Science, and Decentralized Space Exploration

DeepVenture.io is making big changes in how space inventions are handled. We've made a platform where people can easily and safely share and trade their ideas in space.

## The Problem

The old way of handling patents had problems. It was controlled by a few, not clear, and hard to access. This made it tough for people to work together and be creative. We use technology, like blockchain and digital tokens, to fix these problems.

## The Solution

On our platform, people in the space field can list their ideas, look at others, and make sure they're credible. Because we use these digital tokens, everyone can see who owns an idea, and it can't be changed or faked. This is deeply rooted in the principles of Open and Decentralized Science.

But we're not just a place to trade inventions. We want to help people in the Decentralized Space ecosystem to work together. Our platform helps them find others to team up with and make novel space tech.

We focus on big tech areas like earth, environmental, and space sciences. This gives us special help to those making decentralized science and space tools.

## Achievements

We created proof of concepts that DAOs can support Decentralized Science projects or verified concepts of building out open-source marketplaces for Decentralized Science and Space Exploration. We're building a strong community and toolset to accelerate scientific progress and the pace of innovation to utilize Space technologies for good!

## The Path Forward

DeepVenture.io isn't just a project; it's our dream for the future of space tech. We believe that by being open and working together, we can do big things in Space. That's also the reason why we're supporting the newcomers of our Decentralized Space Exploration ecosystem. Join us as we change how space ideas are shared and grow. Let's explore space together!

## Accelerated Scientific Progress

Ultimately, we envision a future where decentralized methods are transforming venture building and corporate innovation. Using rapid prototyping, we can speed up advancements in hardtech, similar to the progress seen in biotechnology. The goal is to make open, shared, and cooperative design, engineering, and production a reality, moving from fiction to fact with global innovation communities.",https://www.deepventure.io,bafkreifjkx6ylzixef5nx2ytcmtwjipmhhqxfng34phhu65djnske2sjg4,bafkreieb3jjbsx2ilj2iq2r634gr775lxxnd4lncnntlvnvwqif4qcooce,NA,NA,DeepVentureio,bafkreib3wwvprcpshxsksbj27pt3isfje4wnqg2ua5sveiobqals3vjym4

~Kevin O‚ÄôConnell, Former Dir. of Space Commerce at the US Department of Commerce and Copernic Space Board Advisor

Copernic Space is at the forefront of revolutionizing the space industry by creating a comprehensive marketplace for space assets, enabling individuals, investors, and companies to participate in the rapidly growing space economy. Our mission is to become the go-to platform for buying, utilizing, and trading space assets, positioning us as the fundamental infrastructure provider in the largest economy of the future.

## **Space Assets Revolutionized**
Space assets encompass both real-world space assets, such as payloads on rockets and satellite imagery, and financial space assets, which involve investments in real-world space assets or space companies. Copernic Space facilitates the tokenization and trade of ownership of these assets through our blockchain-based platform, ensuring seamless transactions and direct access to the utilities and benefits they offer.

### **The Problem We Solve**
The space industry lacks a comprehensive marketplace for accessing space assets and opportunities, resulting in no discovery for the commercial market, inefficient transactions and business processes, limited growth and funding options for space ventures, and restricted access to space assets for individuals, local governments, organizations, and companies around the world.

### **Our Solution**
Copernic Space addresses critical needs in the space industry by providing a marketplace for space assets, streamlining transactions and utilities through tokenization, and democratizing access to the commercial market as well as revenue and funding for space ventures. Our platform facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of space assets and creates new opportunities for liquidity, return on investment (ROI), and growth through a secondary market for assets and investments.

### **Empowered by Strong Partnerships**
Copernic Space is empowered by a strong network of space companies and strategic partners as we pioneer access to space assets. We have already secured support from three venture capital firms, multiple space angel investors, and partnerships with over a dozen space companies. Our roadmap includes launching payload asset sales such as our current Moon sale, expanding commercial access to satellite imagery, IP, patents, and space data, and introducing SpacePool, a decentralized finance (DeFi) app that democratizes access to space investments.

## What is Project Orbuculum and how is it related to space?

We are a start-up recently graduated from [ESA (European Space Agency) BIC Austria](https://www.sciencepark.at/p/dlteo-2/), working on a platform powered by blockchain technology that enables collaboration in the Earth Observation (EO) sector, streamlining the monetization and processing of EO data and AI, and providing cost-effective synthetic EO intelligence. 


To put it simply, our technology ensures that all satellite data and AI models (for Earth Observation) are processed directly on the blockchain. Additionally, constellation operators encrypt their information and then access our platform, and this encryption remains intact throughout the entire process. Consequently, end-users can effortlessly merge Level 2 EO data from various satellite operators and seamlessly extract the final business insights at the lowest cost without ever touching raw data. This is made possible through the support of on-chain algorithm providers, including academic institutions and third-party solution providers, many of which are SMEs associated with ESA BICs. 

This approach could be highly beneficial for companies in need of monitoring their facilities, as they would be able to gain insights from our services as if they had their own virtual satellite constellation. We believe that we are introducing a novel business model that we anticipate will be advantageous to every participant in the EO market ecosystem, from researchers and constellation operators to the end users. 

## An instrumental platform enabling a frictionless and rewarding EO/GIS ecosystem.

There are 3 parties in our platform:

- Constellation Operators (aka Data Provider):
  - what they need to do on Orbuculum: 
    - Encrypt L2 EO data locally (if it is private data, for example [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en) or [CRESDA](https://www.cresda.com/zgzywxyyzxeng/index.html) are open-source datasets), using FHE ([Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Fully_homomorphic_encryption))
    - Upload encrypted data to Arweave
    - Waiting for money...(in a nutshell lol)

- GIS/EO researchers and solution providers (aka Algorithm Provider):
  - what they need to do on Orbuculum: 
    - Implement their research from paper to algorithms or even AI models
    - Compiled locally via our Transpiler to the smart contract(s) 
    - Upload it to Arweave (there will be some cryptography protection here as well)
    - Waiting for money...(in a nutshell)

- End users (including but not limited to Web3 Climate dApps):
  - what they need to do on Orbuculum:
    - Combine Algos/Models with certain pieces of encrypted data (NO decryption during the whole process!) to process data on different layers/levels -> get an encrypted and customized business intelligence
    - Since the EO data product is **[minted as an NFT](https://orbuculum.xyz/mint-earth-as-nft)**, paying for it is a similar user experience as Opensea/Blur
    - decrypt the data product via smart contracts -> check how to use this info to make the world better!

## How is your project supporting Decentralization?

The essence of the Orbuculum revolves around empowering the **DeSci (Decentralized Science)** community within the space industry. This initiative aims to provide GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and EO (Earth Observation) researchers with financial independence, liberating them from reliance on large corporations and government funding. The approach involves monetizing their research, which contrasts with the current scenario where corporates often utilize this work without compensation.

Moreover, our approach aids end users in breaking free from dependence on centralized data platforms, intermediaries, or large satellite corporations. This is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized constellation operators, who often struggle to connect with clients needing their specific data. Without this service, these smaller operators risk being acquired by larger satellite conglomerates due to their early-stage challenges in finding suitable clients.

In this model, constellation operators can upload encrypted data to Arweave. GIS developers are then incentivized with tokens to process this data without needing to decrypt it. This ensures the delivery of final business intelligence directly to non-expert end-users, marking a significant shift in Web3 paradigms.

## How is Orbuculum supporting the growth of the Decentralized Space Ecosystem?

With more and more GIS/EO researchers joining Orbuculum, we woule be able to build a autonomous ecosystem and pioneer a transformative approach by transmuting AI4EO models into smart contracts. This enables automatic remuneration for the creators each time their models are deployed, fostering an efficient and rewarding Earth Observation ecosystem. 

Orbuculum's potential extends far beyond the reinvention of the GIS/EO research industry. It is poised to serve as an invaluable conduit for public welfare initiatives, especially those striving to mitigate climate change. By providing access to vital data and insightful analytics, Orbuculum promises to act as a potent resource in the ongoing battle against some of the most urgent global concerns. This integration of cutting-edge technology with socially impactful missions could position Orbuculum as an instrumental platform at the intersection of scientific research and sustainable development.

By enhancing its downstream Earth Observation (EO) ecosystem, Orbuculum provides crucial financial backing to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the satellite manufacturing and launch sectors. This support ensures a more balanced and diverse space industry, preventing centralization and domination by large corporations.

Current local coordination efforts can't translate globally, the decentralized way built on global incentives is the way. 

Space DAO.

# Problem in Space Traffic Management

Today, there are about 400 collision alerts in Earth orbits updated daily. Current space traffic management methods are centralized and reliant on a single source for collision predictions, raising concerns about technical biases, transparency issues, information manipulation and efficiency (see tables comparison of two different sources over seven observations). These predictions are extremely complex.

![Statistics table on CDM data precision](https://spacedao.ai/static/img/space_dao-STM-stats-table.png#g1stdsqf ""Max 1km missed distance prediction error"")

Today, uncontrolled reentry crashes happen in deserts and oceans (2 tons every week, up to 5 tons every two weeks). In the next 6 years, 1 out of 3 uncontrolled space object reentry has very high probability to crash on a city. There is an obvious lack of global governance in space traffic management and in the whole new space economy.

The increasing population of space objects significantly augments the risk of collisions as well as secondary collisions. Far, as little as a decade, from a Kessler Syndrome (with hypothesis of 150000 active objects in orbit, this is a chain reaction of collisions potentially totally disabling usage of certain orbits), the current lack of neutral and decentralized coordination is even more catastrophic with consequences in terms of geopolitical tensions and radical decision in rights to space access.

Today, there are more than 56 000 objects including debris of more than 10cm and active satellites in orbit. They all navigate at an average speed of 7km/s (yes 7000 meters per seconds, a two hour walk in one second), this means a 70g apricots in space has as much energy as a heavy truck driving full speed in a city. Anything in orbit is classically unstoppable.


# Solution

A more than 91 Billion euros downstream space European market depends on global (= the world) safe space operations. Exploration and utilization of Earth orbit and beyond need incentivized coordination to build consensus in most critical decision making processes as well as to serve as regulatory medium for matters such as space traffic management, satellite-based emergency mapping for on ground disaster response management and in space resource management to grow our orbit coherently between business and science.

![Space View With Close Flying Objects](https://spacedao.ai/static/img/spacetraffic-management-cover.png ""Space Traffic is soaring"")

Space DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), presents a global incentivized collaboration and coordination network. As a transparent and decentralized platform, the DAO supports applications (DApps) that can aggregate data from multiple sources and employ a consensus mechanism to validate and approve collision predictions, and other key information used in high stake decisions (such as disaster response, stakeholders ratings, etc.).
It provides a more robust and reliable system for preventing unnecessary or, worse, disastrous decisions.

Through decentralization, the DAO incentivized the confrontation of different sources of information fostering trustless exchange between participants in order to enhance the accuracy of predictions, and reduce the reliance on any single entity. Operators maneuver their spacecraft based on this consensus allowing them to prevent unnecessary moves and high risks of secondary conjunctions. Regulators, auditors, insurers or space lawyers can over-watch and understand orbital situation globally in order to create relevant rules and additional incentives that matters.

Being a DAO, all stakeholders can actively participate in decision-making processes, ensuring that their collective expertise is considered. Ultimately, the DAO can contribute to a safer, more efficient, and equitable future for space exploration and utilization.

# Current Progress

 - European Space Agency Tech Innovation project for the concept design of blockchain based on-chain consensus mechanisms in collaboration with University of Strathclyde, Parametry.ai and Vision Space Technologies. Now keyed as ""Space DAO"".
 - Creative Destruction Lab graduation for Parametry.ai: validating Space DAO as a massive impact project and evaluating all project risks and possibilities.
 - Space professional community creation with involvement including, space lawyers, space operators and space situational awareness providers and enthusiasts.
 - Our involvement in Web3 communities and resources to support the DeSpace QF crowd funding initiative to support all projects for a more decentralized space. 
 - First consensus contract for single scalar based consensus in solidity that we connected to external Web2 APIs thanks to the API223 tool we are building - another interesting by product for Web3 python developers.

# Future work

 - Nurture recent incubation in the European Space Agency business incubator.
 - Build the full stack of smart contracts for space traffic management
 - Write our full paper for our accepted abstract at the 10th Annual Space Traffic Management conference (Austin, TX, USA)
 - Test decentralized work (such as DeWork) to decentralized the maintenance of the contracts.
 - Being more present on social networks, especially decentralized one (e.g. Mastodon)
 - Set up a neutral entity, foundation or NGO to sustain Space DAO activities.

Abstractedly speaking, Space DAO ensures its decentralized applications build valid consensus on key predictive information used in high-stake decisions:
 - Space Traffic Management (today issue - discussed here)
 - Disaster Response (future issue - already part of the initial work on Space DAO)
 - Any other future business application relying on predictive information that you would submit.


# Why web3 crowd funding

We want create full project independence. For now we are running on the funds of a small startup which risk being associated as the main and only maintainer of the smart contracts. While it is a model that is well in use, we would like to avoid it and propose instead of network of decentralized contributors rewarded thanks to your donations and then network activities when sustainable.


# Key Information

 - Official project website: https://spacedao.ai
 - Official open discussion channel: https://app.element.io/#/room/#space-dao-community:matrix.org

 - Mastodon: https://mastodon.world/@spacedao_ai
 - Twitter/X:  https://twitter.com/SpaceDAO_ai/

## Why the "".AI""?

Key information exchange is often generated by AI algorithms. Space DAO can be seen as a high level AI output verification network by confrontation. Hence it builds consensus across AI predictors or generators like a ML ensemble method would do across weak learners.

Space DAO uses EVM-compatible machine learning techniques to build consensus and updated information sources trustworthiness.

## We use, produce and support the creation of open source assets

The goal is that SpaceDAO can be continued generation after generation without requiring specific central authority agreement.

This means that using only twitter or github is not viable for us.

We use Gitlab as git/CI/CD platform as anyone has freedom to roll out their own gitlab instance (Gitlab is open source) even if a centralized authority/company decides to discontinue the convenient online service.

Also we are present on Mastodon and Matrix network as they are decentralized communication platforms. There is no ghosting or central censorship, and the network cannot be put down by merely central decisions.

Looking forward for your support.

Decentraplace is a new web3 platform that makes it possible to collaborate on pixel art NFTs. Utilizing smart contracts, Decentraplace tokenizes the concept of r/Place and creates an investment product around this seemingly simple concept.

Decentraplace is a mix between an ERC20 token (PLACE) and an ERC1155 collection (NFT collection). PLACE tokens are used to burn in order to color on-chain pixels on decentraplace.io. This creates a deflationary mechanism for the PLACE token, as the more people use the platform, the more PLACE tokens are burned and removed from the supply.

To further incentivize activity, Decentraplace rewards users with NFTs for burning PLACE tokens. These NFTs can be used to boost PLACE staking APY by up to 10% per NFT. The more NFTs a user has, the higher their APY will be and no need to deposit the NFT. We also added new features like a OnChain Messenger and a new DeFi gamemode. 
Our 3 gamemodes are called OnChainInk, PhantomMessenger & LuckyEleven. 
OnchainInk is the best choice for users who are looking for a traditional pixel art experience with a focus on permanence and artistic expression. LuckyEleven is the better choice for users who are looking for a fast-paced and rewarding experience. PhantomMessages is the best choice for users who are looking for a unique and innovative way to communicate and interact with others on the blockchain.

Decentraplace is still in its early stages of development, but it has already attracted over 200 beta testers and ensured flawless functionality since April 2023. The project has successfully completed a total of 6 testNFT snapshots on the Sepolia Testnet, and is now preparing for the first stage of the mainnet launch: Tokenless.

Roadmap

Launch tokenless version: Decentraplace will launch as a tokenless platform to allow users to experience a extremely simplified version of the onchain pixelart platform. This will lower the barrier to entry and demonstrate the core solution that we offer: Permanent, Collaborative Art. 

Genesis NFT launch: Decentraplace will launch a Genesis NFT collection to reward early users and supporters.
DAO launch: Decentraplace will launch a DAO to give holders governance over the protocol and fine tune the Token design pre-Token launch.

Token launch: Decentraplace will launch its token, PLACE, once the DAO is in place and the protocol is fully developed.

Why Gitcoin?

Gitcoin is a great platform for Decentraplace to raise funding because it is aligned with our values of decentralization and open source development. We believe that Gitcoin is the best way to reach a community of users and supporters who are passionate about building the future of Web3.

Why is Decentraplace a good fit for the Mask Network ""Web3 Social""-Gitcoin grant?

Decentraplace is a community-driven project that is committed to building the future of web3. We are passionate about creating a platform that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

Decentraplace is also a deflationary project, which means that it is not susceptible to the same inflationary pressures as other cryptocurrencies. This makes it a good investment opportunity for those who are looking for a long-term hold.

Message from the Founder

As a solo founder, I am excited to apply for a Gitcoin grant to support the development of Decentraplace, a promising new web3 project. 
My goal with the grant money is to hire marketers,advisors and strategic partners to help launch and grow the project. Additionally AMA's will be organized I believe that this investment will be essential to achieving my goal of making Decentraplace a leading web3 platform.

I will measure the success of Decentraplace by tracking the following metrics:

Number of active users
Total transaction volume
Number of unique projects launched on Decentraplace
Number of partnerships established with other web3 projects
I believe that these metrics will provide a good indication of whether Decentraplace is achieving its goal of becoming a leading web3 platform.

## [Download Dev Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)

The goal of LunCo is to integrate Space & Robotics industry existing models into one Virtual World, allowing collaborative (concurrent) engineering.

While focused on Space Engineering, it's not limited to it. With Godot as a 3D engine, it's **easy to add new functions and models, e.g. plan Solar Power Station parameters,** and concept of operations, e.g. how often to clean panels.


The funds from this particular grant would be used to tokens modeling support in LunCo opening ways to model complex systems in scenarios like:
1. Solar panel produces energy, tokens are issued based on that
2. Tokens could be ussued for different activites, like collecting lunar dust
3. With that capability user would be able to model different effects of tokenomics in virtual world

Such a capability to model tokenomics in LunCo could be for interactive token engineering, and modeling complex systems up to a city scale, teaching TE in a fun and engaging way


The below diagram highlights the overall idea.

## Why Web3?

Web3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. 

The most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.

## Sustainability {GHGs)
Decentralized library, focused on sustainability and environmentally conscious content, can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in several ways:

- Reduction of Physical Resources: Traditional libraries often require large amounts of paper, ink, and other physical resources to produce and distribute printed books and materials. By promoting digital resources and e-books, a decentralized library can significantly reduce the demand for these resources, resulting in fewer emissions associated with their production and transportation.
- Energy Efficiency: Centralized data centers and physical libraries require substantial energy for heating, cooling, and maintaining the infrastructure. Decentralized libraries, powered by blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, can potentially operate with lower energy consumption, especially if the network uses renewable energy sources.
- Minimized Transportation: Traditional library systems involve the distribution of physical books to various locations. This transportation contributes to GHG emissions due to the use of fossil fuels in the delivery process. A decentralized library eliminates the need for physical transportation, reducing emissions associated with the shipping of books and resources.
- Reduced Deforestation: Decentralized libraries can discourage deforestation by advocating for the use of digital content rather than paper-based resources. Reduced demand for paper products can help protect forests and reduce the carbon emissions associated with deforestation.
- Remote Access: By providing users with easy access to digital resources from anywhere in the world, a decentralized library can reduce the need for individuals to travel to physical libraries. Fewer trips to library locations mean fewer emissions from transportation.
- Environmental Education: Decentralized libraries can curate content on environmental sustainability, climate change, and green technologies. By providing access to these resources, they can help educate the public about climate issues and inspire action to reduce GHG emissions.
- Blockchain for Carbon Offsetting: Some blockchain projects and cryptocurrencies are exploring ways to support carbon offsetting initiatives. A decentralized library could potentially integrate with such initiatives to facilitate carbon offset donations or rewards for users engaged in sustainable practices.
- Support for Green Initiatives: A decentralized library can serve as a platform for sharing information about local and global green initiatives and sustainability projects. It can connect users with resources on renewable energy, eco-friendly practices, and climate change mitigation efforts.
- Peer-to-Peer Sharing: Decentralized libraries can encourage users to share resources with their peers, reducing the need to purchase new books or access new digital content. Sharing and peer-to-peer exchange can help minimize resource consumption and reduce the carbon footprint of producing new materials.
- Data Security and Privacy: Ensuring data security and privacy can reduce the likelihood of data breaches or cyberattacks that could result in energy-intensive data recovery and restoration processes, thus minimizing associated GHG emissions.

## Summary
In summary, a decentralized library that emphasizes sustainability and digital resources can help reduce GHG emissions by minimizing the demand for physical resources, decreasing energy consumption, reducing transportation-related emissions, and fostering environmental education and awareness. Such a library can play a valuable role in supporting global efforts to combat climate change and promote a more sustainable future.",https://decentralized-library.vercel.app/,bafkreiax7v46geo5lvrdgz3zokbu4fd4xjhklmkf5j5zibm2zteok4q4iy,bafkreieq5736c4eo55k4ffawoxtn3kixlb277vp7tjp7upcfrcy6tf6ssi,holyaustin,NA,holyaustin,bafkreign5rb37ahtsmazuwvh5rljvqwxgj2uxta4f5vhl32io6luiku5na

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has far-reaching effects on the environment. Northern Nigeria is no exception to this.

Extreme weather patterns‚Äîfiercer, longer dry seasons and shorter, more intense rainy seasons‚Äîare exacerbating challenges confronting local communities. Extensive cultivation and overgrazing have been compounded by desertification, soil erosion, and other environmental problems that have affected the livelihoods of people living in the region

Problem

Continuous deforestation is happening in Northern Nigeria because of the need for food, medicine, charcoal, and timber. The loss of tree cover in a rainy, mountainous area has had severe environmental consequences. In addition to tremendous loss of biodiversity, the region experiences soil degradation, erosion, desertification and landslides.

Specific focus with this grant funding

Our goal is to plant 1 million trees in Northern Nigeria by 2030 through our school campaign program that is aimed to reach 10,000 students in the region. We will achieve this by partnering with local organizations, schools, and communities to promote tree planting and environmental conservation. We will also provide educational resources and training to teachers and students to help them understand the importance of environmental conservation. Our specific focus is on empowering school children on tree planting

Solution

Climate change is a global challenge that requires collective action to mitigate its effects. One way to address this issue is through tree planting and school campaigns. By providing environmental skills and knowledge to rural school children, the children will be empowered to protect their local environment.

Why we need your Support

Our vision is to create a sustainable future for generations to come by promoting tree planting and school campaigns. We believe that by planting trees, we can help to mitigate the effects of climate change and create a more sustainable environment. We also believe that by raising awareness about environmental conservation through school campaigns, we can inspire young people to take action and make a positive impact on the world.

Because of the awareness created by this project, the children and the community will learn to nurture the trees, and not cut them down. The knowledge of planting and protecting the trees will be passed on to the next generations. If this project succeeds, we will identify additional sectors in which trees can be planted, and spread our good work.",https://gpci.com,bafkreidowatfc2rrslsffnpbhybzwyprfldzdv5hb4jrtj7gjj2z43s27u,bafkreifqbrofyx2l7mskonhswyrlbdg2wbdrj3b42jykhn4rgsbz6olctq,eddydon850,NA,greateddydon,bafkreiheedtmtpcwe5ptfunus6whqstwayxzuyo5c2lbq7q4autxxewbje

It helps ensure that property is more productively utilised by the society, resulting in an increase of overall economic productivity and general welfare of society. It keeps the power of the market, whilst reducing the inefficiencies in how property is currently allocated. At a relative cost to efficiency in investment returns, it reduces the prevalence of monopolies that exclude society from an asset‚Äôs wealth generating capabilities."" - https://medium.com/@simondlr/what-is-harberger-tax-where-does-the-blockchain-fit-in-1329046922c6

-----
KaliBerger is a tool for creatives to freely try out Harberger's tax on their ERC721 NFTs. 

Harberger's tax works as follows:
- Owners periodically evaluate their property by giving it a dollar amount and pay taxes based on its value.
- Potential buyers can force a sale by purchasing the property from the owner at any time.

Based on this set of rules, we, the legal engineers at LexDAO, is building a pattern that allows anyone to sell ERC721 NFTs with variable Harberger's tax rates based on the type of Creative Commons license selected, and when tax is collected, ""BergerTime"" is triggered and all tax revenues are automatically pooled into a DAO (specifically, KaliDAO) consisting of the creator and patrons.

To illustrate, creators may impose lower tax rates for more permissive licenses (e.g., CC BY) and impose higher tax rates for less permissive licenses (e.g., CC BY-NC). In addition, purchasers may also update the type of CC license for the duration of their ownership if they selected a different CC license from that set by the creators.

Lastly, we, the legal engineers at LexDAO, hope to enlist LexClinic's support and work with Creative Commons to draft and develop modified versions of CC licenses  to better suit this NFT x Hargerber's tax x CC license arrangement.

When tokens are non-fungible this is an easy task. Many NFTs are designed to hold little or no monetary value, and high symbolic content.

As an example, [POAPs](https://poap.xyz/about-the-protocol) are minted to symbolize memories of specific moments and events in time and/or space.

Fungible tokens cannot escape holding monetary value, but can they be designed to allow a richer symbolic value as well?

**Could we create a token still compatible with permissionless automated market makers, but also useful for holding non-monetary values?**

# Can a token carry meaning?

Kernel in their essay brings attention to the [signature economies](https://sign.kernel.community/essay) embedded in blockchains:

*‚ÄúSignatures do not enclose, they bear individual witness to shared events. The messages you sign are at once totally unique‚Äîthere is only one valid signer in the whole world‚Äîand yet they can be broadcast many times over, each time accumulating meaning.‚Äù*

And then asks:

*‚ÄúCan we create a culture where value is propagated by ongoing response, rather than held captive in possessions?‚Äù*

# This token engineering research project aims to:

- **explore the possibilities for designing a token able to carry and express symbolic value**

- **develop open source smart contracts available for the community**

- **deploy at least one example instance of a SymVal token as a demonstration of its potential**

# The path so far:

We started with the question: **How to code symbolic values in smart contracts?**

Inspired by ancient ""technologies"", we are exploring the idea of borrowing concepts and practices from Buddhism, such as prayer wheels, mantras, holy temples / stupas, with the goal of deploying a digital version of them to the blockchain.

To pursue this idea further, we have started a series of conversations with Marlon Barrios Solano, with the goal of arriving at a token model.

Marlon is a creative technologist and researcher with a background in software engineering, improvisational dance, and embodied awareness, and also a resident meditation teacher and guest movement instructor for Kernel.

As an early experiment we also asked:

**Can a token display more than just a balance in a wallet?**

Together with Simon Wairiuko from the Regro Project we proposed an idea for a token on the NEAR blockchain, taking advantage of the fact their token standard includes an on-chain token icon image supported by the NEAR wallet.

Simon is an artist, farmer and developer, and he created an interactive SVG that shows day/night cycles, a tree's respiration cycle, and localized seasons like Winter and Summer, based on the device‚Äôs location and time zone.

This early experiment dealt only with the token UI display and not yet with the underlying contracts and logic, but was already a step towards the main research question.

The SVG can be visualized at: https://teia.art/objkt/651699

# üåé About Commons Stack

Commons Stack innovates at the intersection between culture and token engineering.

We build technical tools and cultural frameworks that enable impact initiatives to evolve into decentralized, regenerative, self-governing communities. Our expertise lies in guiding communities through the process of creating an organizational structure that facilitates active participation, cooperation, and accountability. You can build a community-driven ecosystem that fosters positive change and ensures your project‚Äôs long-term success.

These four pillars present our approach to funding, governance, and public goods management:

**Cultural frameworks:**  We provide comprehensive cultural frameworks that empower impact-focused communities to form, fundraise, and govern effectively, ensuring their long-term success. These frameworks are designed to accommodate the unique needs and challenges of DAOs, offering flexible, research-based solutions that respect both collective and individual autonomy.

**Economics Co-design:** We champion Economic Co-design, a methodology that promotes inclusion, transparency, and active participation, enabling community members to create their own economic design proposals. This ensures diverse perspectives are heard, fostering the growth of innovative and practical solutions tailored to community needs through a 3-step process: educate, propose, and vote.

**Research:** We conduct research to innovate collective governance and economic design tools for web3. Our research-led approach allows us to create adaptable templates that cater to the unique needs of diverse communities.

**Library of Tools:** We curate a library of tools, comprised of modular, interoperable solutions that empower communities to fund projects and establish regenerative token economies. These tools, including the Augmented Bonding Curve and Conviction Voting, facilitate the launch of CommonsDAO and complement the creation of a sustainable, polycentric governance model.

To enable more communities to launch and interact with their own ABC, we have recently rolled out the [ABC Launch](https://launch.abcswap.xyz/) and [ABC Swap](https://abcswap.xyz/) MVP.
The ABC Launch dapp enables individuals and projects to create an Aragon DAO and deploy their own Augmented Bonding Curve. It offers customization options for parameters such as opening price, reserve collateral and entry/exit tributes, empowering projects to create DAO-owned liquidity and unique microeconomies. The ABC Swap facilitates swapping of tokens launched and governed by ABCs. 

![ABC graph](https://imgur.com/Fn6hSzr.png)

# ü§ù Our Commitment to Open Source

Open source fosters a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual respect. It gives builders worldwide access to tools and resources that collectively drive research and social and technological advancements.

We champion a culture of radical openness as we believe transparency advances projects and productivity ethically and inclusively. We actively practice the philosophy of open source by building in public.


# üåüOur History of Success

We launched the first Augmented Bonding Curve for the Token Engineering Commons in 2021, and [$TEC has maintained parity with ETH in a bear market](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipSAI5M1Yo_nWEgfxMfY5n_lGq6SFrog/edit#gid=1569207494) (only down ~15% vs ETH) while the ABC collected $300k via swapping fees for TE Public Goods. This economic model is a significant milestone towards ""Impact = Profit"".

In 2023, we deployed Aragon OS & our CommonsDAO tools such as Tao Voting and ABC to Optimism. Tao Voting features Delegation and ""Wait for Quiet"" to prevent last-minute vote manipulation. The [ABC Launch](https://launch.abcswap.xyz/) enables communities to launch and interact with their own ABC, providing a no-code solution to launch economic systems like friend.tech.

Our Conviction Voting model has been adopted by notable projects like Gitcoin, Giveth, TEC, 1Hive, BrightID, and more.


# üéØ What's Next with the Funding

We‚Äôve been in pursuit of more funding to expand the reach of our CommonsDAO tooling, including the Augmented Bonding Curve, Tao Voting and Conviction Voting. After the successful launch of the ABC Launch and ABC Swap MVP, our goal is to extend our CommonsDAO tooling to more networks and communities. This means more public good projects gaining access to our innovative tools and ability to launch an ABC to fund and govern their missions, empowering them to create sustainable token economies and effective governance models. We‚Äôre also currently working on the next versions of ABC Launch and ABC Swap and planning for future releases. 

In addition to supporting our specific projects, the funding from GG19 will provide a much-needed boost to our overall operations, particularly in navigating the challenges of the bear market. üêª  We believe in the resilience and potential of the Commons Stack community, and with your support, we can continue to innovate and drive impact, regardless of market conditions.

## What is an On-Chain Smart Contract Firewall?

Smart contract hacks have been plaguing DeFi protocols, bridges, and more.

Today, in order to defend themselves, protocols perform audits, open bug bounties, and implement monitoring.

All of these steps are absolutely crucial. Nevertheless, whenever a vulnerability is discovered by an attacker, most exploits can drain funds in a very short period of time, sometimes even within a single transaction. To prevent these hacks from happening, we need an on-chain tool.

You can think of the Smart Contract Firewall as an additional layer of security for DeFi protocols.

Our Firewall is a set of Solidity Smart Contracts that allow you to:

- Define critical parameters for your protocol (e.g., TVL) and track these parameters over time.
- Detect that a transaction (or multiple) is causing the protocol to operate outside its normal activity (e.g., unusual liquidity outflow, indicative of a potential hack happening).
- Implement a set of protective measures, including transaction blocking, protocol pausing, fund freezing, or controlled fund withdrawal, before the transaction is committed and funds exit the protocol.

The Firewall provides a way to detect abnormal changes in your protocol directly on-chain, that could be indicative of a hack. That means that you can act upon abnormal activity, whenever it occurs, directly on the blockchain.

This makes it easier to write complex scripts for various day-to-day blockchain operations, such as creating efficient DAO votes, launching and managing DAO configurations, performing DeFi strategies, running simulations on drafted on-chain actions, and creating, sending, and managing tokens.

EVMcrispr effectively lowers the technical barriers for web3 users to engage in and execute complex tasks using smart contracts. The tool's **domain-specific language is useful for expressing and transforming transaction data**. It has been adopted by organizations like Curve, Aragon, NFTX, 1Hive, Giveth, TECommons, BrightId, and Agave to conduct intricate votes within their Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

The tool boasts a terminal-like interface, complemented by clear documentation and numerous examples, making it easy for users to start. **It eliminates the need for a customized frontend to interact with Ethereum**, as users can simply write and share scripts with others for execution.

## Examples

Here are examples of scripts that perform day-to-day ENS actions. You can find more examples on how to use EVMcrispr [in the documentation](https://evmcrispr.com).

## Roadmap

EVMcrispr is committed to continuous improvement and expansion of its features. The following next steps have been identified to enhance the tool and user experience:

1.  **Bug fixing and improved error messages:** Addressing and resolving any existing issues or bugs in the current implementation, ensuring a seamless user experience. We are dedicated to refining error messages to better inform users about potential issues and failures.
2.  **Formal language specification:** Developing a well-defined and comprehensive formal language specification to provide clear guidance for users and facilitate future improvements. The language specification will also be useful for LLMs to program transactions properly.
3.  **Event handling and output integration:** Implementing event handling capabilities to enable better tracking and monitoring of smart contract events and transactions. The outputs of the events will be made available in the script to inform and initiate subsequent transactions.
4.  **Safe support:** Integrating support for Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), a widely-used smart contract wallet, to further broaden EVMcrispr's compatibility and utility for users within the ecosystem.
5.  **Improved ENS support:** EVMcrispr will make ENS names first-class citizens of the domain-specific language. The tool already supports the `namehash` and `contenthash` functions to manage ENS domains.

By focusing on these key areas, EVMcrispr aims to become an even more versatile and valuable tool for interacting with smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains.

## Abstract

As trust in traditional systems erodes and AI development accelerates, IRL interactions and other ‚Äòplace-based‚Äô interactions (physical and digital (i.e. DAO cartography)), become increasingly valuable sources of signal for reputation systems. These signals are typically costly, naturally Sybil-resistant, and high-bandwidth. They can be leveraged to authenticate online interactions (e.g. grant proposals). They can also potentially serve as proxies to measure embodiment, relationality and other phenomena with more direct connection to ‚Äòterritory‚Äô (as opposed to more conceptual ‚Äòmaps‚Äô of reality). These signals could be particularly useful for tokenomics designers seeking to create fairer, more ethical systems that reimagine access to spaces in novel ways.

The goal of this work is to systematically explore place-based reputation in the context of tokenomics. This will be done by reviewing relevant literature, defining place-based reputation in tokenomics terms, imagining possible use cases, exploring data privacy and security issues, and using the SourceCred (SC) reputation protocol to create a prototype application for place-based reputation. Reputation scores will be generated for a sample community, then feedback from the participants will be collected for analysis.

## Methodology

- Literature survey of place-based reputation as it relates to tokenomics. How is place-based reputation defined in various domains (academic, web3, etc.)? What are example applications of place-based reputation, in theory and real-world applications? What methods can be used to transpose virtual spaces to physical space representations (i.e. DAO Cartography)?
- Workable definition (if doesn‚Äôt already exist) of place-based reputation in token engineering terms.
- Analysis of data privacy, security and other ethical considerations of place-based reputation.
- Survey of web3 reputation systems and other tools applicable to place-based reputation
- Create custom SourceCred (SC) instance to generate reputation scores based on participation in a specific place (physical or digital). I will likely start with the [BridgeSpace Commons](https://twitter.com/BridgeSpacePdx), a physical community space in Portland (OR) I‚Äôve been participating in for the past year (if participants consent), which was recently host to the [General Forum on Ethereum Localism](https\://pdxdao.xyz/localism/). Custom instance will be created by using an existing plugin (Initiatives plugin) with novel configuration.¬†
- Present generated Cred scores to participants and gather feedback.
- Publish results and analysis in article, including OS code, data and methodology

## Project details

1. _Individual or team summary (size, relevant experience, social profiles, etc.)_

Seth Benton (@zen\_bacon on Twitter/X, @s\_ben on discord) will be the main (and potentially sole) contributor. I will be in discussion with SourceCred community members that have collaborated with me in the last year on work that inspired this proposal (notably @AL0YSI0US, @Marcie and @HartVyne), who may also collaborate. I‚Äôll also be reaching out to individuals in the space with relevant knowledge and experience, who may collaborate.¬†

2. _What specific problem(s) do you seek to solve with this grant, and how will you know whether you have accomplished your goal(s)?_

By better understanding the solution space opened up by place-based reputation, I seek to create new affordances for designers of tokenomics systems. My baseline goal is to see active engagement with my deliverables from the token engineering community (discussion of findings, references to article, etc.). My larger goal is to see builders incorporate findings from this work into systems I can experience as a participant.¬†

3. _Describe how your project contributes to token engineering and why is it a valuable public good._

Place-based reputation could allow for better management of existing spaces (e.g. parks that can be permissionlessly updated or maintained (City Repair)), the creation of new forms of public spaces not currently feasible due to lack of trust (e.g. property owners that could create permissionless access to currently inaccessible places, functional DAOs, etc)).¬†

4. _What stage do you consider your project is currently in? (PoC, MVP, fully integrated project, etc.)_

PoC. I have already created an initial PoC based on meeting attendance (regular video calls, including a space facilitated by a licenced dance movement therapist) in the SourceCred community. I‚Äôm confident that extending this to attendance at IRL events will at minimum yield valuable insights, and likely lead to promising new product directions.¬†

5. _Please share any new updates or milestones from the prior months._

In March of this year, SC received \~3k DAI from DAO Drops as part of their first round of retroactive public goods funding. We planned to use the discord plugin to create Cred scores with which to distribute the funds. However, we ran into unexplained errors in the output; likely due to the plugin code not being actively maintained. As a backup, I used an experimental plugin (the Initiatives plugin) that had been largely unexplored, which allowed me to manually enter data on meetings (the primary form of contribution for regular participants). This worked surprisingly well, and I worked with the community to tweak the algorithm parameters and get [scores that were satisfactory enough to distribute funds](<https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/dao-drops-proposed-distribution/1454/1>).¬†

These results gave me confidence that a similar process could be used to analyze attendance data generally, and perhaps other types of place-based data.¬†

Last month, at the General Forum on Ethereum Localism (GFEL), I created an unconference session on place-based reputation where I pitched this general idea, riffed on place-based reputation generally, and was encouraged by the general enthusiasm of the participants.

6. _Previous project funding sources (VC, grants, token sales, etc.)_

SourceCred was previously funded by Protocol Labs, however the last [distribution of funds](<https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/proposal-organizational-wind-down-pay/1391>) to contributors was in April 2022. Since then, the only funding the community received was \~3k DAI from DAO Drops, retroactively funding the community‚Äôs work supporting the protocol.¬†The work that inspired this proposal has not received any funding to date.

Mechanism Institute is a think tank that advances building blocks for digital-age institutions. We bring together builders and researchers to study, develop, simulate, and deploy coordination mechanisms that prioritize people and positive-sum outcomes.

# The Library

Our current centerpiece is the [**Mechanism Library**](https://www.mechanism.institute/library), a compendium of over 130 mechanism design patterns and 300+ implementation examples. We're actively working to add detailed write-ups for each entry that describe its background, advantages, drawbacks, design considerations, and in-depth case-studies that show how the mechanism has been used in practice.

# New Research

This library is just the beginning. We've already begun to introduce a range of tools and resources for navigating the vast landscape of mechanism design possibilities. Here is some recent progress on this front:
- We released the [**Mechanism Impact Measurement**](https://observablehq.com/@mechanisminstitute/impact-measurement) tool, a forkable workbook to model ROI of mechanisms, including cost of capital & demand forecasting.
- We released an early prototype of the [**Mechanism Design Canvas**](https://www.figma.com/file/oS1LLUNeyAHwbS9UQw8YRe/Mechanism-Design-Canvas-Template), a visual template for designing systems in a way that ensures shared understanding of goals and system architecture.
- We released early designs for two **new cryptoeconomic primitives**:
  - [Slashing Engine](https://github.com/Mechanism-Institute/slashing-engine) with Gitcoin to help incentivize sybil detection
  - [Smart Treaties](https://www.figma.com/proto/Sg0srz4rVhMdxbGEmCD7PE/Smart-Treaties?type=design&node-id=235-97&t=mj6927VIsczIyAon-0&scaling=contain&page-id=1%3A8&starting-point-node-id=235%3A97&show-proto-sidebar=1) with Zuzalu to help networked communities scale
- We have given eight **Mechanism Seminars** that provide practical strategies and tools for designing better mechanisms: [Paris](https://observablehq.com/@mechanisminstitute/5-research-directions-for-blockchain-mechanisms), [MetaGov](https://twitter.com/mechanism_inst/status/1694412042864845291), [dOrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg6SZwSEwUY), [Berlin Ethereum Meetup](https://twitter.com/BerlinMeetup/status/1703486696195551269), [Metafest](https://youtu.be/oloMD4zvLTE?si=-QBQWLIf0RRsXZF9) [x2](https://youtu.be/zfXlR1km-2Y?si=OhenNh5EQJPaKcW1), Commons Hub Austria, [Bonding Curve Research Group](https://twitter.com/Bonding_Curves/status/1721906922335748524).",https://mechanism.institute,bafkreiguy2toq2zmafccqnslbsubsln44e2525lwnbwvwu5sc5eknfqd5m,bafkreibbzla5hhompjod7mdjdruay7kqblwan3umokuthdt4kl3qtnk4uy,orishim,Mechanism-Institute,mechanism_inst,bafkreigmpqvtmlvk7lqhsd3plicyjmjsc6tvxjslg4xanjrs6c45h3fy4q

It is the connection between different blockchains or blockchain structures so that data and assets can be transferred between them.

But doing so is not easy. With development capabilities, safety, accuracy, and various costs. Even though there is a popular bridge now, it cannot accept every network.

If you have an idea that you want to use Bridge to send and receive data on any net

We have developed some amazing a special innovation. Smart contracts and front-end compatibility are accurate, secure, and fast (as is sending token)

This is what we doing. It is a unique ERC-20 bridge that supports all EVM Chains. It works similarly to WrappedToken, but with the special ability it can receive and cross networks correctly. I call this project ""Wizard Bridge EVM | Fact Protocol Interface : (Proof of Message)""

Sustained bear markets have been a huge challenge for token valuations, with many DAOs and organizations seeing massive selloffs and price drops in the 90%+ range. When token price is a primary driver of the capacity to carry out work in a DAO ecosystem, volatile token prices are a hindrance to production in Web3 organizations.

 üö¶The Opportunity:
Using bonding curves as a continuous token issuance mechanism, organizations or communities can leverage algorithmic reserve and liquidity management strategies to provide volatility-damped token price fluctuations. The Token Engineering Commons Augmented Bonding Curve is a prime example of this, outperforming ETH through the bear market. This should be studied and exemplified in order to broaden education on these tools, and establish connections with organizations who need help designing and deploying them, which could also serve as revenue streams for further work and research.

üí™ Seizing the Opportunity:
This research group will provide research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms. This research body and content deliverables will attract new talent and interest in the field of Token Engineering, and it will additionally allow for a common understanding and language around bonding curves and their applications to DAOs, businesses, finance, and economics in general. This research could offer improvements for understanding the design and ongoing operation of these new economic mechanisms, benefiting the field of Token Engineering directly through upgraded tools like dashboards and simulators, but also indirectly through networking and deal flow.

Bonding curves are an emergent, Web3 native, economic primitive that redefine markets and liquidity. By determining price as proportional to supply, liquidity can be built into an economy, ending the era of market crunches, and enabling transparent and discoverable market prices for assets. The research, development and education in token economic primitives like bonding curves and cutting-edge research in the TE field has profound potential and implications for our economic systems.

‚§¥Ô∏è Overview of Bonding Curves:
Bonding curves are an interesting new tool in the Web3 space, which can provide various automated dealer functions that tie two or more elements of a system together through mathematical relationships encoded into smart contracts. Also called automated market makers (AMMs), there are different types of bonding curves, including but not limited to constant product, constant function, concentrated liquidity, variable product, time-weighted, and even order book-based bonding curves. Bonding curves have also been ‚Äòaugmented‚Äô with the addition of common pool treasuries or even prediction markets, in order to improve the collective signaling capacity of these new tools for social and ecosystemic benefit. 

This is just the beginning of their utility, and current tools have only taken the first steps to explore this design space. Bonding Curves are a gateway for engineered control systems to facilitate and improve the economic management and value accrual systems of Web3.

Our mission is to drive forward the research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms.

üéØ The Purpose of this Research Group:
The goal of this proposal is to establish a foundation for continuous research, development, and education around bonding curves. Our aim is to establish a deeper understanding of bonding curves in general, and a more thorough analysis of their applications thus far, including the TEC Augmented Bonding Curve. We plan to create a content funnel about bonding curves that educates the wider public and motivates projects seeking bonding curve expertise to connect with our community. This, in turn, will fuel the growth and development of the bonding curve space while providing economic opportunities to those involved with developing bonding curves for projects.

‚öôÔ∏è Continuous Development and Research Methodology:
It is worth noting that research initiatives are fundamentally different from development processes, which is one reason we are proposing this as a research ‚Äòmarathon‚Äô work, as opposed to more task-based ‚Äòsprints‚Äô commonly held on faster time cycles among development teams. Research is fundamentally an exploratory exercise, often without clear outcomes at the outset of the initiative. For that reason, we will set deliverables such as content production timelines and hours input into processes as they‚Äôve been laid out, rather than trying to determine ahead of time the exact topics or outcomes produced by the end of this first research marathon.

üìö Past Work & Achievements : 
The BCRG was founded in March 2023  and has three operational workstreams including Education & Content, Research & Ideation and Bonding Curve Analysis & Modeling. Here is a list of some of the work produced:

OmniFlux stands as a token and liquidity transport protocol, dedicated to establishing an open standard facilitating seamless token operations across multiple blockchain networks. Our core mission revolves around providing token developers with a universal framework, empowering them to create tokens that transcend single-chain limitations.

Through our protocol, developers can integrate BridgeAdapters such as LayerZero, Axelar, and Omni deployment. This integration enables the minting and burning of tokens, establishing a fluid and efficient transfer mechanism that effortlessly spans across diverse blockchain environments.

Central to our offering is a comprehensive, permissionless User Interface, designed to empower users with the capability to transfer any token aligned with our standard. Notably, token teams and developers retain complete autonomy throughout the entire token development process; our involvement/permission is not a prerequisite for their success.

How it works: 

Problems Developer Faces with Omnichain Token (Token operating between multiple chains)

- Liquidity: Token issuers must continuously incentivize liquidity for each new bridge/chain AND require all end users to take slippage when transferring.

- Fungibility: Each time new bridges transfer a token, they each deploy their own version of the token, fragmenting liquidity and creating a broken user experience.

- Sovereignty: Whenever a bridge mints their version of a token, the token issuer loses control over the token contract on that chain.

- Lock In: Other proposed solutions to this problem require you to lock yourself into a single bridge and its security model forever.

- Complete stack: Other proposed solution to this problem doesn't provide permissionless stack to use their resources, like frontend to execute the transfers between chain

Solution we Offer

- Liquidity: For Token supporting our standard their won't be need to maintain liquidity, also tokens will be transferred on 1:1 ratio, i.e no slippage

- Fungibility: Each BridgeAdapter uses the same version of token, so liquidity wont get fragmented 

- Sovereignty: Developers own the contract 

- Lock In: There will be no Lock-in with a single provider, token issure/developer can allow/remove any BridgeAdapter at anytime, also users can select their preferred GMP provider from our UI

- Complete stack: We offer a permissionless stack, from token deployment to using our UI with new tokens, everything is permissionless and works seemlessly

## TLDR ‚ú®

The [Ecofrontiers](https://ecofrontiers.xyz/) Map is an application enabling the discovery and trade of green crypto-assets across the planet. 

=> *https://www.ecofrontiers.app/* <=

## Vision üåç

Without substantial public and private investment, we won‚Äôt be able to protect the biosphere at the scale it needs. The emergent Web3 natural capital asset market is promising, but fractured. Assets are hard to find, and hard to trade. With its Map, [Ecofrontiers](https://mirror.xyz/ecofrontiers.eth/TYJd-4ktkw4gmpgPbxKIlgPCEloTKvT1fuVLIL_SiyQ) aims to offer an alternative to the current state of the decentralized environmental asset market, where:

* Projects tokenizing natural capital are in need of a clear and intuitive platform to display the location of their assets.
* Organizations, governments and individuals willing to buy tokenized natural capital are in need of a unified interface enabling asset discovery beyond carbon.
* Environmental projects aiming to tokenize natural capital are in need of a platform to show where they are operating and advertise their project.

## Solution üó∫Ô∏è

The Ecofrontiers Map is a location-based aggregator enabling the discovery and trade of tokenized environmental assets throughout the globe.
The Map is being developed in three phases:

1. Display of all tokenized natural capital assets, with description, asset type, and link to corresponding marketplace. The search is enhanced through a filter mechanism.
2. Projects aiming to tokenize natural capital will be able to pin their projects to the map to expand their reach.
3. We aim to enable the purchase of tokenized natural capital assets directly through the interface.

## What has been done so far üßë‚Äçüíª

A first functioning prototype of the [Ecofrontiers Map](https://www.ecofrontiers.app/) has been deployed. The team has developed this first test version of the Map using MongoDB and Mapbox. The Map displays eight different asset providers (a.k.a. ""issuers""), and six asset types, for a total of 26 assets to discover. We also added a filtering feature that enables the search for specific assets according to their type, and issuers. See this [LucidChart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/24d4faed-a81f-4512-9704-6c905636020b/edit?viewport_loc=-2196%2C-1327%2C4192%2C1995%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_41f3082c-5eca-42e9-b35d-32660f39e639) to get a high-level understanding of the architecture. 

Beyond this map prototype, Ecofrontiers is a research and advocacy program to advance the potential of Web3 technologies in natural capital markets. Our first campaign and associated industry report, ‚ÄúNew Frontiers in Eco-Capitalism,‚Äù targets environmental policy-makers, green funds, and environmental projects to improve the conditions for natural capital production at scale. A [sample chapter](https://mirror.xyz/ecofrontiers.eth/zkh2LoADInAgr7GLbXnsuUOEcwJKFE4GuUSYuYU22io) unveiling what might to the best of our knowledge be the **first mapping of green crypto-assets** has been published on October 30th. **This mapping serves as the basis for the classification of the assets displayed on the map.**

## Outputs üí™

The grant work will result in the following concrete outputs, from most to less likely depending on donations:

* Back-end work to refine the Map, add additional issuers such as the Toucan Protocol.
* Front-end work to refine filtering of the assets, improve UX/UI design.
* Deployment of a public beta version of the Map on the Ecofrontiers website by end of Q1 2024.
* Create a form accessible on the Map for natural asset providers to declare their environmental assets to be listed.
* Make the buying of green crypto-assets possible directly through the Map interface.

Decentraplace is a new web3 platform that makes it possible to collaborate on pixel art NFTs. Utilizing smart contracts, Decentraplace tokenizes the concept of r/Place and creates an investment product around this seemingly simple concept.

Decentraplace is a mix between an ERC20 token (PLACE) and an ERC1155 collection (NFT collection). PLACE tokens are used to burn in order to color on-chain pixels on decentraplace.io. This creates a deflationary mechanism for the PLACE token, as the more people use the platform, the more PLACE tokens are burned and removed from the supply.

To further incentivize activity, Decentraplace rewards users with NFTs for burning PLACE tokens. These NFTs can be used to boost PLACE staking APY by up to 10% per NFT. The more NFTs a user has, the higher their APY will be and no need to deposit the NFT. We also added new features like a OnChain Messenger and a new DeFi gamemode. 
Our 3 gamemodes are called OnChainInk, PhantomMessenger & LuckyEleven. 
OnchainInk is the best choice for users who are looking for a traditional pixel art experience with a focus on permanence and artistic expression. LuckyEleven is the better choice for users who are looking for a fast-paced and rewarding experience. PhantomMessages is the best choice for users who are looking for a unique and innovative way to communicate and interact with others on the blockchain.

Decentraplace is still in its early stages of development, but it has already attracted over 200 beta testers and ensured flawless functionality since April 2023. The project has successfully completed a total of 6 testNFT snapshots on the Sepolia Testnet, and is now preparing for the first stage of the mainnet launch: Tokenless.

Roadmap

Launch tokenless version: Decentraplace will launch as a tokenless platform to allow users to experience a extremely simplified version of the onchain pixelart platform. This will lower the barrier to entry and demonstrate the core solution that we offer: Permanent, Collaborative Art. 

Genesis NFT launch: Decentraplace will launch a Genesis NFT collection to reward early users and supporters.
DAO launch: Decentraplace will launch a DAO to give holders governance over the protocol and fine tune the Token design pre-Token launch.

Token launch: Decentraplace will launch its token, PLACE, once the DAO is in place and the protocol is fully developed.

Why Gitcoin?

Gitcoin is a great platform for Decentraplace to raise funding because it is aligned with our values of decentralization and open source development. We believe that Gitcoin is the best way to reach a community of users and supporters who are passionate about building the future of Web3.

Why is Decentraplace a good fit for the Mask Network ""Web3 Social""-Gitcoin grant?

Decentraplace is a community-driven project that is committed to building the future of web3. We are passionate about creating a platform that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

Decentraplace is also a deflationary project, which means that it is not susceptible to the same inflationary pressures as other cryptocurrencies. This makes it a good investment opportunity for those who are looking for a long-term hold.

Message from the Founder

As a solo founder, I am excited to apply for a Gitcoin grant to support the development of Decentraplace, a promising new web3 project. 
My goal with the grant money is to hire marketers,advisors and strategic partners to help launch and grow the project. Additionally AMA's will be organized I believe that this investment will be essential to achieving my goal of making Decentraplace a leading web3 platform.

I will measure the success of Decentraplace by tracking the following metrics:

Number of active users
Total transaction volume
Number of unique projects launched on Decentraplace
Number of partnerships established with other web3 projects
I believe that these metrics will provide a good indication of whether Decentraplace is achieving its goal of becoming a leading web3 platform.

I am confident that Decentraplace is a worthy project of your support, and I look forward to working with the Gitcoin community to make it a success.

Mesoamerican Reef DAO (MesoReefDAO) is a Regenerative Coral Reef Science initiative that focuses on the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of DeSci (Decentralized Science) that seeks to scale coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR).
The Mesoamerican Reef is indeed the second-largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 600 miles along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras (Fig 1). It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.


![alt text](https://wwflac.awsassets.panda.org/img/new_mar_map_01_1_531910.png)

MesoReefDAO is working to establish partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and governments to support the implementation of sustainable fishing practices and the development of marine protected areas in the MAR. The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).

Fig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.


**Mission** 
The MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.


**Vision**


The MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats, improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.


**Problem**


The problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.


However, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.


![alt text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fr8DvnxWYAAQOnv?format=jpg&name=large)
Fig 3. Coral Outplanting areas in the Mexican Caribbean.


**How?**


MesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.


The framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerate coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4).

**In this proposal, we aim to further develop and expand the capabilities of MesoReefDAO through the Climate Solutions category of the Gitcoin Grants program.**


Our proposed project includes:

1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.


2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.


3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.


4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will be used to automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.

Today it is very difficult for startups to get investment in truly incredible projects. There is a crypto market whose capitalization as of November 21, 2023 is $3.12 trillion. The Up Chain project, with its own blockchain and its own UPC coin on its platform, will combine investments in startups (from different fields) and the huge crypto market. What are the advantages? Startups will receive a huge investment market, and the crypto market will receive a new investment tool. A bright future will be closer with Up Chain.  But our team needs an initial investment of $200,000 and subsequent investments. The future belongs to startups with Up Chain.

To¬∑ken En¬∑gi¬∑neer¬∑ing /Ààt≈çk…ôn/ /enj…ôÀàniriNG/

1. An emerging engineering discipline focused on holistic systems design and the theory, practice, and tools used to design and verify tokenized ecosystems i.e. cyptoeconomic systems and their simulation using tools like cadCAD.

2. A discipline of responsibility; adhering to the highest principles of ethical conduct (from ethical engineering)

3. A community pushing forward the field of token engineering in theory and practice. (See more Modeling Crypto Protocols as Complex Systems, TE Process)

The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning ‚Äúcleverness‚Äù and ingeniare, meaning ‚Äúto contrive, devise‚Äù.

ABOUT THIS GRANT

""üåâ Just as civil engineering lets people feel confident driving across a bridge without reading its blueprints, token engineering does the same for society's next critical infrastructure: crypto-economic systems. 

‚öôÔ∏è Token engineering provides the tools and processes to ensure that blockchain systems are safe, resilient, and trustworthy. This analytical rigor is crucial for building public trust and adoption of Web3 technologies. It's the essence of Web3 public good. ""  -Token Engineering Commons @tecmns
                     
The field of TE is incredibly important to bridge the gap of emerging and reliable tech to build sound digital public infrastructure. 

Funding education in the field is crucial to train more practitioners to meet the growing demands of rapid growth in the development of cryptoeconomic systems and new forms of digital organization.

I had the honor and opportunity to work on the first-ever free educational course in Token Engineering - TE Fundamentals - offered by the Token Engineering Academy. https://tokenengineering.net/

Working with TE Academy Founder Angela Kreitenweis and several other research colleagues, I created the governance module - condensing hundreds of videos, articles, and academic papers into a course and extensive library for open study. The work took 6+ months (and a lot of blood, sweat & tears) and it is still only scratching the surface of study.

If you haven't had a chance, I encourage you to check it and the other modules out:
https://tokenengineering.net/course/tef-module5/

I would like to repurpose the content into articles for easier and wider digestion for folks who may not have the time or interest to do an entire course, but are interested in selected topics, and create a more accessible bite-sized body of knowledge. 

In addition, I would love to refer anyone interested in contributing to the creation of educational TE materials, particularly in governance, to communities and channels working on various layers of study.

HOW YOUR DONATIONS WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS

Donations received will go towards hiring a writer(s)/editor(s) to support in the process. There was at one point a TE writer's guild who created incredible content, but due to a lack of funding, could not continue their valuable work. 

I will be sourcing support from that group, and although some of them would volunteer, I would love to be able to compensate them for their time in creating these highly valuable public goods.

I'm a solopreneur and developer in web3.
Since 2019 in Crypto, I would love to share my knowledge as a builder and user.
I'm also present to publish and create content in my personal account of X: 

Founder in X: https://twitter.com/MSG_Encrypted

WUW needs to work hard on a great tokenomics for its token. We want to provide our R&D in public. Get feedback to bring the best values of the tokens.
I've worked a lot as a Developer in Web3 and been in front of several tokenomics.

Managing basic parameters like Supply, price, circulating, total supply, inflations, and staking.

Other tokenomics parameters like: 
 buy pressure, sell pressures, inflows, outflows, interactions, and synergies between different actors that can use differently the tokens.

I want to experiment and trydifferent tokenomics in my app WUW, for the SocialFi at this moment.
Next, I want to do some R&D and experiences for the DAO, and DeFi sector in Web3.



ABOUT WUW:

WUW is a SocialFi and Quest app Community tool.
A lot to do to bring a valuable tokenomics, and sustainable to this sector.
Gonna build in public.

Build for the project/DAO, Nonprofit organization (NPO), content creator, and users in mind.

As an NPO (Non-Profit Organization), you can create your projects page, and relate your content in a web3 manner.
The NPO can receive donations from a web3 wallet in several chains. Also, we want to enable bank payment donations and other financial tips for NPOs.

You can keep the transparency of how your funds can be used with a web3 wallet in blockchain or the backend app that gives transparency with a wallet integrated.

Gamification for NPOs to give better transparency, and that's more visibility through the app.
Incentivize to save the world.

In our next milestone, we want to enable the ability of a project/brand/NPO to create DAOs and proposals.

On the MVP we will use only off-chain and IPFS.

The first implementation On the chain we are gonna try is with Filecoin DAO.

The link below for more examples: https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-data-dao-kit.

The first milestone for DAO is to have proposals and voting. After we want to be able to direct execution directly on the Governance contract.

We have done the R&D and some proposals into another DAO like the Mango market in the past. We want to experiment:

Have different weights for users depending on XP skills and other data.
We love to continue this research and experiment with it. The other part of the project can help to bring this type of weight and data.

Send a DM if you want more information.

The app is built in a multichain mind: EVM chains like Optimism, ETH, Polygon, ARB, OP, zkSync, Scroll, and more.

Also built for Web3 Oauth is enabled with Twitter, Google, and Discord.

I'm a solopreneur and developer in web3.
Since 2019 in Crypto, I would love to share my knowledge as a builder and user.
I'm also present to publish and create content in my personal account of X: 

Founder in X: https://twitter.com/MSG_Encrypted

WUW needs to work hard on a great tokenomics for its token. We want to provide our R&D in public. Get feedback to bring the best values of the tokens.
I've worked a lot as a Developer in Web3 and been in front of several tokenomics.

Managing basic parameters like Supply, price, circulating, total supply, inflations, and staking.

Other tokenomics parameters like: 
 buy pressure, sell pressures, inflows, outflows, interactions, and synergies between different actors that can use differently the tokens.

I want to experiment and trydifferent tokenomics in my app WUW, for the SocialFi at this moment.
Next, I want to do some R&D and experiences for the DAO, and DeFi sector in Web3.



ABOUT WUW:

WUW is a SocialFi and Quest app Community tool.
A lot to do to bring a valuable tokenomics, and sustainable to this sector.
Gonna build in public.

Build for the project/DAO, Nonprofit organization (NPO), content creator, and users in mind.

As an NPO (Non-Profit Organization), you can create your projects page, and relate your content in a web3 manner.
The NPO can receive donations from a web3 wallet in several chains. Also, we want to enable bank payment donations and other financial tips for NPOs.

You can keep the transparency of how your funds can be used with a web3 wallet in blockchain or the backend app that gives transparency with a wallet integrated.

Gamification for NPOs to give better transparency, and that's more visibility through the app.
Incentivize to save the world.

In our next milestone, we want to enable the ability of a project/brand/NPO to create DAOs and proposals.

On the MVP we will use only off-chain and IPFS.

The first implementation On the chain we are gonna try is with Filecoin DAO.

The link below for more examples: https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-data-dao-kit.

The first milestone for DAO is to have proposals and voting. After we want to be able to direct execution directly on the Governance contract.

We have done the R&D and some proposals into another DAO like the Mango market in the past. We want to experiment:

Have different weights for users depending on XP skills and other data.
We love to continue this research and experiment with it. The other part of the project can help to bring this type of weight and data.

Send a DM if you want more information.

The app is built in a multichain mind: EVM chains like Optimism, ETH, Polygon, ARB, OP, zkSync, Scroll, and more.

Also built for Web3 Oauth is enabled with Twitter, Google, and Discord.

This emerging market represents one of the first significant markets being influenced and transformed by Web3 technologies. We hope to gain valuable insights into decentralized governance on both intra- and inter-organizational levels and novel forms of organization that can inspire not only the Web3 world.

## Necessity
For several reasons, understanding the dynamics of the Voluntary Carbon Market's blockchain-based ecosystem is crucial. Firstly, it allows us to explore how Web3 technologies reshape traditional markets and industries, paving the way for more sustainable and transparent practices. Secondly, by studying decentralized governance models within this ecosystem, we can uncover innovative approaches to governance and collaboration that have broader implications for organization design. Lastly, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how blockchain technology can be leveraged to address global challenges such as climate change.

## How your donation helps
By mapping the core organizations and interactions within the Voluntary Carbon Market's blockchain-based ecosystem, we will provide valuable insights into its evolution over time. This research will shed light on governance structures, organizational characteristics, and collaborative dynamics within the ecosystem. These findings can inform policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers seeking to understand and replicate successful models of decentralized governance in various sectors.
Under this project, we plan to create a series of case studies of core organizations in the ecosystem. We will leverage insights from these case studies together with datasets on inter-organizational ties (networks) to explore the dynamics of the ecosystem. We will make all the underlying datasets as well as any research papers publicly available.
By supporting our project, you will advance our understanding of decentralized governance, organizational design, and the transformative potential of Web3 technologies in traditional markets. Your donation will enable us to produce comprehensive research on the Voluntary Carbon Market's blockchain-based ecosystem.

## Our research group
The project will be conducted by a research group at Masaryk University, Czech Republic, led by Michal Jir√°sek, Ph.D. We are an open-minded group of young scholars with network ties into both the traditional academic world (e.g., top-ranking universities in the Netherlands or Germany) and several Web3 projects (especially DAOs focused on the Voluntary Carbon Market).
[See Michal‚Äôs profile on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=26XTBW0AAAAJ&hl=cs ""Google Scholar Profile"").

## Progress
We have already made some progress on this project. We have conducted several studies on the Voluntary Carbon Market's blockchain-based ecosystem, including a published case study on Klima DAO in the Journal of Organization Design. Additionally, we have ongoing work-in-progress studies that further explore different aspects of this ecosystem.

## Eligibility
We have a track record of conducting impactful research in various domains (strategic management, innovations, etc.). Although research on DAOs, or more broadly on Web3, represents a relatively new domain for us, we have already published several studies and have other ones in the late stage of progress.",https://muni.cz/go/gitcoingrr,bafkreidm4neznllffeh25ujyuvmpqkqaal2netlfcytenadyynajactgka,bafkreiddctdu5i6mogcshlcjlwyumgovtcjgmrof6ylntixfosby5htcom,NA,NA,NA,bafkreibrn644umfbb7tkzht3q3sdubppyz2zhaaxqg7bwqunfhabuh43ku

Funding will go towards development, marketing, and legal costs for developing and distributing the tools to other communities.

DAO platforms are an important but challenging vertical in the Web3 space. Seen as a type of ""holy grail"" for crypto, many projects have attempted to innovate in the space, and each provides valuable insights and lessons for others to learn from.

Mirror is a DAO platform specifically designed for residential communities wishing to operate in a decentralized fashion. It uses a Slack-based chat-bot interface to allow residents to engage in community governance and manage shared resources. The underlying technology involves innovative time-based mechanics, which can serve as a case study for other projects to learn from. So far, the mechanisms have been very effective, allowing a non-technical userbase to meaningfully engage in community governance.

Mirror was developed by game designers, economists, and crypto-economic engineers, and has been successfully deployed to a 9-person house in Los Angeles. The prototype implementation runs on a Web2 stack, with plans to target a Web3 backend on the horizon. The project was open-sourced under AGPL-3, with subscriptions to a managed service being used to support long-term development. This is a similar approach that projects such as Loomio, Ghost, and Proton have taken in the past.

Mechanism Institute is a think tank that advances building blocks for digital-age institutions. We bring together builders and researchers to study, develop, simulate, and deploy coordination mechanisms that prioritize people and positive-sum outcomes.

# The Library

Our current centerpiece is the [**Mechanism Library**](https://www.mechanism.institute/library), a compendium of over 130 mechanism design patterns and 300+ implementation examples. We're actively working to add detailed write-ups for each entry that describe its background, advantages, drawbacks, design considerations, and in-depth case-studies that show how the mechanism has been used in practice.

# New Research

This library is just the beginning. We've already begun to introduce a range of tools and resources for navigating the vast landscape of mechanism design possibilities. Here is some recent progress on this front:
- We released the [**Mechanism Impact Measurement**](https://observablehq.com/@mechanisminstitute/impact-measurement) tool, a forkable workbook to model ROI of mechanisms, including cost of capital & demand forecasting.
- We released an early prototype of the [**Mechanism Design Canvas**](https://www.figma.com/file/oS1LLUNeyAHwbS9UQw8YRe/Mechanism-Design-Canvas-Template), a visual template for designing systems in a way that ensures shared understanding of goals and system architecture.
- We released early designs for two **new cryptoeconomic primitives**:
  - [Slashing Engine](https://github.com/Mechanism-Institute/slashing-engine) with Gitcoin to help incentivize sybil detection

Flexible Voting is an extension to the widely used Governor system pioneered by Compound and used by many DAOs. It allows arbitrary delegate voting contracts to roll up the votes of many token holders. This provides a permissionless interface for all kinds of new usecases related to onchain DAO voting.

## About Flexible Voting

Flexible Voting was originally developed as part of a grant from the Uniswap Foundation. It adds a simple building block to governance: the ability for a delegate to split voting weight across For, Against, or Abstain when submitting votes to the Governor contract. This capability is especially useful when a contract serves as the voting delegate. We call this feature ""Flexible Voting.""

![](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/master/readme/flex-voting-diagram-transparent.png?raw=true)

This new building block allows for all kinds of new integrations and experiments to be built without compromising the security of a DAO's core Governance. A few examples of things that can be built with Flexible Voting include:

* Voting with tokens while earning yield in DeFi
* Voting on L2 with bridged tokens
* Shielded voting (i.e. secret/private voting)
* Optimistic off-chain-to-on-chain vote bridging
* Incentivized voting
* Quadratic voting
* And many more..

Importantly, the Flexible Voting extension provides a permissionless interface for third parties to develop new voting contracts, implementing whatever integrations or rules they'd like to see. We expect to see lots of innovation around DAO voting to occur using Flexible Voting.

## Project Status

The Flexible Voting extension is complete and has been [audited](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/scopelift-flexible-voting-audit/) by OpenZeppelin. It was also audited again by Trail of Bits as part of the Frax Finance Governance audit.

Flexible Voting is being adopted by real DAOs, including Gitcoin, PoolTogether DAO, and Frax Finance.

In addition to the core Flexible Voting contracts, we've also been busy building out some of the most requested use cases. We [built](https://www.scopelift.co/blog/how-scopelift-built-a-flex-voting-atoken-on-aave) an integration with Aave thanks to a grant they provided, and an equivalent [implementation](https://www.scopelift.co/blog/flexible-voting-on-compound) for Compound funded by a grant from that protocol. We also received a [grant](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/14/layer-2-grants-roundup) from the Ethereum Foundation to prototype Layer 2 voting with bridged governance tokens, and are in the process of [finalizing](https://github.com/ScopeLift/l2-flexible-voting) that work. We also built a [Uniswap v4 pool](https://github.com/ScopeLift/delegated-liquidity) that allows token holders to vote while providing liquidity.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScopeLift/l2-flexible-voting/main/img/l2_flexible_voting_diagram.png)

## What's Next

In addition to working with several DAOs to see Flexible Voting adopted, we're also working with Tally and other DAO tooling providers to see it integrated into their products. As mentioned, we're building out several of the most requested usecases for Flexible Voting ourselves. In particular, we hope to launch an MVP of L2 Flexible Voting in the next couple of months.

While we're excited to build out some of these usecases, we expect most voting contracts will ultimately be built by third party developers. We've had discussions with several third parties who are hoping to build their own integration with Flexible Voting. We want to focus on making the developer experience for third parties as easy as possible. That's why continuing to improve our documentation and easy-to-extend base contracts is another priority.",https://flexiblevoting.com,bafkreiapduplccz2ncgforcn7k7chtadicp5u4c3gpwgjwgymmd37k5hqe,bafybeihiwolir4unpxcezqd27oyl3jar2inincc7kzu7fmvvwjhd575gce,ScopeLift,ScopeLift,ScopeLift,bafkreihx7fao2gijuujsrvzn5gsisbfzroyiagbb2fhwxsr3a5yylvfczi

# What's Inferer?

Inferer is a user data protocol service in web3. We're providing identity analysis service, project evaluation service and finally serve the connection service between user identity and project ranking, which we believe we would be the next generation of airdrop.

# What's our vision?

Inferer would serve to advance data rights for users in web3.


# What we've done all the way down since 2021?

Inferer launched on the grant by PlatON in late 2021 early 2022 and keeps building since that time. We learned a lot, explored a lot, and now we try to contribute more to this great crypto community. Hope Inferer would generate more values to our community. That would be most worthwhile for inferer.

We put every milestone for record here in inferer. Hope you will like it.



# Update

2023/10/7:

1: We're so excited to announce that Inferer has officially launched our Inferer Identity product https://id.inferer.xyz NOW. Brand new design, beautiful design style, smoonth product user experience. No more chrome plugin edition, full mode desktop product, just gorgeous. We have put so much time in iteracting Identity product, including 3 versions PRD, 7 versions Design documents, and 3 big rounds of internal iteration from v1.0 to v1.3(current version). And now we made it, with such a great product quality which we're pretty pround of. Hope you will like it.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F71P27-akAAcK-9?format=jpg&name=large)

2: This brand new identity product introduces our latest great Inferer User Portrait system, which utilize our internal user label system and classfication algorithm and provide a great way to check crypto user's portrait. We believe it would generate quite lot of values in future user related products. We're pretty excited about that.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F71QPw0bsAAdQtv?format=jpg&name=large)

3: Moreover, Identity is so good, but we're also developing a crazy product in the meanwhile - Inferer Airdrop. We've mentioned that before, and you could imagine that it has progressed quite far away both in product concept and engineering feasibility verification. All these are getting done while we're polishing our great Inferer Identity product. Lots of new stuff and ideas, just crazy. Contact us to get enrolled in early bird product version and we do have an exciting plan to enroll, expand and stimulate. Airdrop would not be a simple airdrop any more. We believe it did have a chance to generate quite much value to our crypto community. It would be mind blowing.

2023/7/29:

1: We're excited to announce that Inferer officially supports Inferer Ranking on website https://ranking.inferer.xyz. It offers great product quality with concise on-chain data analysis! Brand new product user experience, new design interface, more advanced data analysis, we're offering a high level product and we're pretty proud of it. Again, we're committed to keep improving Inferer Ranking and believe it would bring huge impact in crypto project analysis.

2: We have another great product Inferer Identity is on the way to get online as well (expected late Aug early Sep). That's also amazing! If would introduce a great scoring system for crypto users and provide great values for projects to check their target users avatars. Please give us a little bit time to build it to a great quality and we have confidence that it would surprise you.

3: Recently we're discussing a lot on future airdrop product and have a great finding on this. We're having a demo to verify the concept. We do believe it would be a thing to crypto community.

2023/4/7:

1: For Inferer community gitcoin members, we're back! Back here to report our progress regularly, and brings with an amazing new product - Inferer Ranking.

2: We're excited to announce that Inferer could not only support the on-chain user address identity analysis, but also for on-chain contract web3 projects (especially NFT project). This would be obviously a tremendous scope improvement for Inferer. We hope not only we could provide users efficient identity look up tool (compared with checking transactions in etherscan or polygonscan), but also we could provide a brand new & efficient way helping users checking projects(especially NFT) users' group portraits, which could be a great reference for new users to check whether a project is with good quality or just a scam project to rug pull. We believe some new crypto users would need this and we treat this in a very valuable way!

3: We love Reddit! Not only their avatar nft users grow exponentially from 3m to 10m, but also for the unbelievably great crypto-friendly culture. We enjoy quite a lot in having discussions in Reddit. And it helped us to determine our first project analysis landing on Reddit Avatar Collections. It's quite valuable for us to analyze all avartar through, which gives us a very clear concept that which avartar series is now trending and which nft now leads in profits. We believe this would be quite useful for those reddit avatar traded users. In the long run, we're going to cover many more projects and willing to bring great values for crypto users. We believe this would definetly bring great values to crypto and help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain.

1: We're excited to announce officially that Inferer now has a brand new official site https://www.inferer.xyz. It brings totally new design language and much better user experience. This new version shows great product level in Inferer. We believe that you all would love it.


2: We brought a great internal engineering product here: Inferer label backend system. In order to reach unbelievably lots of labels, we need to improve our label processing efficiency, in a massive improvement way. In detail, it needs to handle label creation, label deletion, label edit, label check, label daily update, label comparison, label degrees and many more label related operations, all in a user friendly way with great efficiency. This leads to our new coming amazing product: Inferer label backend system, which aimed to cover these requirements and take overall label processing efficiency to a much higher level. Inferer label system has come to v1.0 and been put into use NOW. It would also iterate very quickly. We're very passionate to polish this tool to help Inferer reach to next stage.


3: We're excited to announce that AWS has decided to help fund in Inferer! We had amazing conversations and had a very great consensus: Inferer is a great project and would like to see the achievements that Inferer would take in the future. That would be a very interesting thing that we both believed.

2022/11/28:


1. We're excited to announce that Inferer Search has been renamed to Inferer Identity.


2. Inferer Identity has updated to v0.0.13. In this version, we included a major new feature: Inferer Label, which would be the key to our future user identity analysis service. Inferer Label would serve directly into our user portrait system and become the data basis in our evaluation algorithms. We would increase lots of labels to help us reach the precise analysis result.


3. For Inferer Label, not only we're adding more & more labels, we also try to dig more interesting dimensions on labels. We add 'degree' metric to Inferer Label, such as ""Big Ens User"", which refers to users who adopted more than 5 Ens names on their account or ""Ens Collector"", which refers to users who adopted more than 30 Ens names on their account, this extend info would help a lot in figuring out user's motive or interest. We're excited to see the benefit this brings to our evaluation process.


4. On engineering, we want to reach the point that Inferer Internal System could label new qualified users day by day, automatically. And we have covered this NOW.

2022/10/22:

-   Inferer Search has updated to v0.0.10. We put quite much time on many details which we believe would improve users' experience in a long time. Some of them listed:


    1. always focus on the address edit text which could help users to replace new address, and avoid delete address one by one


    2. fix that some users can't launch ""Inferer Search"" through mouse' right click ""Inferer 0x*****"" after they sleep the computer


    3. add more twitter KOLs in Recommend feature, which facilitate users' check on these KOLs' identity


    4. add more hackers info in Warning feature, which we hope could help keep users from scams


    5. integrate internal server APIs to optimize the JSON API response time


    6. add support for users to switch their binding address to inferer account

# **What your support will help us build next**

We believe that the most pressing pain in decentralized governance is the inability to scale effective deliberation. Currently for deliberation on a topic to be open to all DAO members, it has to held on text-based channels, asynchronously and 24/7, by anonymous or pseudonymous participants, with little or no structure.

We have been exploring ways to apply traditional and tested methods of deliberation (e.g Citizens‚Äô Assemblies, Sociocracy 3.0) in the Web3 space manually. With AI-based tools to automate the facilitator‚Äôs cycle of asking, synthesizing, and echoing, we believe we can scale these approaches.

**We are ready to test this hypothesis, and looking to raise funds to:**

- Refine the interaction and usability of the Harmonica bot for large groups`

- Craft and code LLM prompts for 2-3 distinct facilitation methods`

- Test the different facilitation methods in participating communities`

- Publish our learnings on the performance and challenges in these scaled methods

# **What is RnDAO bringing to web3?**

RnDAO is a swarm focused on the future of work.

The Ethereum ecosystem has developed very significant infrastructure, and now we can begin to focus on developing impactful applications.

But how? When a builder has identified the right problem, many lack the research skills to dive deep and the supporting community to pull them out of theoretical weeds. No wonder **75% of hackathon winners abandon their projects and 90% of accelerated startups fail.**

RnDAO‚Äôs proven Venture Studio model finds, funds, and fosters projects that focus on collaboration tech. This work will seed a collaboration-tech product ecosystem that:

- Delivers commercially viable ventures that address societal challenges with impact in both Web3 and beyond
- Develops operational and governance excellence as a key capability for the broader web3 ecosystem

We've cultivated an expert community focused on collaboration challenges, from Oxford to INSEAD, Google, BCG, Aragon, Gitcoin, Polygon and beyond. We connect those passionate about reinventing collaboration with those knowledgeable about the intricacies.

**At RnDAO, we focus on six key Pillars essential for future collaboration technology:**

1. Decentralized Governance: Enables democratic decision-making.
2. Legal & Ownership: Aligns stakeholders through clear contracts.
3. Community & Culture: Promotes vibrant communities and sustainable growth.
4. Financial Management: Streamlines budgeting and resource allocation.
5. Operations & Talent: Manages human resources efficiently.
6. Communication: Ensures effective internal information flow.

Decentralised identity is no exception, but systematically overlooked by the literature.

The majority of small states are not helped by being referred to poster child jurisdictions like Palau, Singapore, the Marshall Islands, or Estonia. Instead, for them to truly benefit from credential-enabled governance they require systematic research that accounts for the indivisibility of cost for small-scale governance and the diversity of small island societies.

Initially funded by York University for one year, this project has successfully led to the creation of a unique method for sybil identification. While sybils, or fabricated identities, support user privacy they come at the cost of obscuring true voting patterns, which frustrates attempts at decentralized, polycentric governance.

The current stage of research focuses on refining, scaling, and validating the technique, with an emphasis on making it robust, reliable, and practically useful. Additionally, the project seeks to engage with and gather insights from Metagov, Web3, and academic communities. This feedback will be crucial for further improvement and ensuring the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. The end goal is to open-source this refined method, contributing a valuable tool to the field of decentralized governance.

## Funds requested and milestones:

January: $5,000

Milestone: Validate and report the method and open source the prepared graph dataset on [Github](https://github.com/quinndupont/SybilGovernance/tree/main).

February: $5,000

Milestone: Solicit community and peer feedback through Metagov collaboration and verify method and model.

March: $5,000

Milestone: Scholarly journal article submitted for review in open access journal. Open source the refined method and model on Github.

April: $5,000

Milestone: Revisions and scholarly journal article accepted for publication. Project is completed.

## Budget justification:

The requested funds are to provide an additional 4 months of research time for Dr. Quinn DuPont to complete this project and ensure alignment with research and practice communities‚Äô tacit knowledge and practical experience. No other funding supports this project.

## Benefits to Metagov Community and Grant Alignment:

This research is theoretically grounded in a model of polycentric, decentralized governance of digital assets, which requires careful management of commonly held resources (aka ‚Äúpublic goods‚Äù) for successful governance. As identified in ‚ÄúOpen Problems in DAOs,‚Äù a persistent challenge facing fair and democratic implementation of polycentric, decentralized governance are sybils. In this context, sybils are defined as voting nodes that behave similarly because they share a common source (a unique person). In most traditional voting settings, one-person one-vote voting is easily accomplished by physically restricting repeat voting, however, in decentralized online settings, it is trivially easy to construct a new persona for every new vote and defeat controls on governance voting. Indeed, in crypto, creating a new (derived) wallet address for every new transaction is considered a privacy maximizing best practice. So, while the easy construction of sybils is a privacy benefit for users, the proliferation of sybils frustrates community managers, system designers and modellers, and social scientists, who are unable to accurately or meaningfully measure or model a governance system with sybils. My research over the last year offers a novel method to identify, label, and combine sybils into predicted ‚Äòtrue identities‚Äô. 

## Impact and results:

This research presents a significant and multifaceted contribution to addressing the issue of sybil attacks in decentralized governance systems. At its core, it offers an advanced method for sybil detection, crucial for enhancing the integrity and reliability of such systems. This methodology not only fortifies the security of decentralized networks but also paves the way for more democratic and equitable governance models within the Web3 space.

A key aspect of this project is its open-source nature, which creates a collaborative environment conducive to innovation and continuous improvement. This approach not only speeds up the advancement of sybil detection technologies but also nurtures a sense of transparency and trust among community members.

Moreover, the implications of this research extend beyond immediate technical applications. It holds the potential to shape future policies and practices in digital governance, particularly in the realm of digital identity verification, far beyond the confines of blockchain technology.

Practical applications of this method are vast. Social scientists and DAO researchers will find it invaluable for generating more precise evaluations of decentralized voting and governance. Additionally, system designers can leverage this method to transform graph signals for more effective modelling. Infrastructure engineers, too, stand to benefit, as they can develop and deploy automated, online versions of this method for proactive sybil defense‚Äîa significant step forward given the current gap between today‚Äôs sybil defense mechanisms and the advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence that have emerged recently and are utilized by this method.

The method itself employs a multilayered, high-dimensional graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) alongside a rapid vector embeddings search and label propagation technique. This inductive, highly parameterized method has been tested extensively with the [Snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/) dataset, proving its efficacy in identifying, labeling, clustering, and amalgamating sybil nodes using well-established and intuitive deep learning techniques. Although the method has shown promising results (~10-15% graph reduction), it requires further refinement, validation, and feedback from the wider community to reach its full potential. A visualization from the algorithm-in-progress shows the method‚Äôs ability to identify sybil nodes, label and combine them, and to construct a sub-graph of ‚Äútrue identities.‚Äù

## Risks and Disclosures

The foundational research is already complete and the primary methods have been developed. Due to the complex, inductive nature of this research, the experimental results may not validate and the method may prove ultimately unsuccessful in practical settings.

As we move further into the space of network-based pluralistic communities, more resources and research is needed to help these communities thrive. Governance isn‚Äôt simply about voting, it‚Äôs a tool that communities are able to use to build and shape the future of their ecosystem. 

While there are varying governance systems and structures out there, a lack of thoughtful engagement, context, and bias can plague them. Not because people are inherently trying to do something bad, but because we are all driven by our own value system, largely based on our individual experiences and when working within a global, pluralistic community, it is inevitable that at some point these things will clash. 

We want to explore this topic on a broader web3 governance level and intend to use our own community, the GreenPill Network to help experiment with the implementation of these findings. 

GreenPill is building a CoordiNation across Nations and Cultures and this requires intentional and thoughtful governance practices that respect differing cultures, ideas, needs, and focuses. 

Objectives:

To study existing governance models used by pluralistic, network-based communities.

To analyze the effectiveness of these models in ensuring participatory decision-making, financial transparency, and value alignment.

To develop a Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) model that is adaptable to the diverse needs of network societies.

Currently, most systems available for these communities are written forums, are there other medians in which we could participate in the governance process?

Literature Review:

Summarize key findings from existing literature on governance models in decentralized and network-based organizations.

Discuss theories and practices in community governance, focusing on pluralism, participatory decision-making, and distributed leadership.

Methodology:

Qualitative Research: Conduct interviews and focus groups with leaders and members of various network societies.

Case Studies: 

Analyze in-depth case studies of successful network communities to understand their governance structures.

Comparative Analysis:

Compare and contrast different governance models to identify best practices and areas for improvement.

Data Collection:

Identify and reach out to network societies similar to GreenPill Network.
Develop interview guides and questionnaires focusing on governance challenges and solutions.

Desired Outcomes:

A comprehensive report detailing existing governance models, their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to network societies.

A proposed Minimum Viable Governance model that includes guidelines for decision-making processes, fund management, and maintaining community values.

This research project is being conducted by Sejal Rekhan and Lana Dingwall who are a part of The GreenPill Network, and other web3 communities, DAOs and networks. They have participated in SeedClub and other web3 governance and community-focused groups.

Modpol is a toolkit for integrating user-created governance processes into online multiplayer games. We have already developed a prototype, and through the Creative R&D Lab we hope to develop it into software ready for large-scale use. Ethnographic research with users will explore the experiences they have and the possibilities future development might unlock. We also intend to entirely redesign the prototype user-experience, to ensure that Modpol is far more accessible to diverse users. Additional software development will help ensure that Modpol is sufficiently reliable and functional to be usable in the context of gaming and other everyday uses. The goal of this project, ultimately, is to make more widespread and available the means for practicing democracy online in varied and culturally appropriate ways.

We are developing Modpol initially as a mod for Minetest, a free, open-source game engine that resembles Minecraft. Its user community is youth-driven and all-volunteer, with many members in low-income countries. Members of the Minetest community have been involved in the development of the current prototype, and we will continue to steer development in ways that follow their stated needs. But because Modpol is designed so that most of the codebase is platform-agnostic, progress made working with a community like Minetest can be ported to other kinds of games, as well as to other non-game online spaces. The software is written in Lua, a lightweight and widely supported extension language.

With Modpol, gaming platforms gain the ability to incorporate user-generated governance mechanisms, which can in turn connect and compose with each other. Groups of gamers can thereby test out different sorts of decision-making mechanisms within their games and develop best practices about what kinds of governance suit their relationships and their goals. 

# Background

Existing online tools inhibit community self-governance in ways that disempower social movements and undermine resistance to Big Tech‚Äîa design pattern known as ""implicit feudalism."" As a result, most people lack opportunities to practice the arts of democracy in their online lives, weakening their capacity to practice democracy in their offline communities and governments. The habits and assumptions of tech elites become imposed against the longstanding legacies of collective governance among diverse cultures. 

In contrast, our community has developed a guiding framework called ‚Äúmodular politics‚Äù‚Äîa way of designing online social systems for diverse, culturally sensitive governance practices, which are also portable and interoperable across many different contexts. This means that governance practices from one community can be shared and experienced by others, facilitating embodied and creative exchange. Modpol puts the concept of modular politics into working code.

Modpol is an experiment in digital democracy, designed to bring diverse, multi-cultural governance practices into the environment of an immersive metaverse. Rather than specifying what governance should look like, Modpol is designed to be a foundation on which users can create their own governance processes‚Äîby mixing and matching existing modules, as well as by developing their own. Thus, in addition to serving as a basis for various forms of governance, we hope that Modpol will cultivate a community of practice, in which users can share, test out, and learn from each other‚Äôs governance practices.

This project has been additionally informed by feminist perspectives. For instance, it is an attempt to challenge the all-too-common patterns that Jo Freeman diagnosed as the ‚Äútyranny of structurelessness,‚Äù and to fill the need she identified for ‚Äúdemocratic structuring‚Äù in communities. We also honor the international process that developed the Feminist Principles of the Internet, which included a commitment to ‚Äúdemocratise policy making affecting the internet as well as diffuse ownership of and power in global and local networks.‚Äù While Modpol begins in game-spaces rather than public policy, we believe (with many leading feminist thinkers) that practices of everyday life are inherently political and also have important shaping effects on large-scale politics.

We carry out this work in the context of the Metagovernance Project, which is a 800-strong global, intercultural community of researchers and designers exploring the future of online governance. Through study, software development, open standards, and play, we work to work toward a world made more just, democratic, and interconnected through self-governing networks. Metagov has a strong commitment to intentionally incorporating perspectives from across cultures in our work. For instance, during the course of this project, Metagov will also be hosting its new Groundwork Fellowship, a program that supports the work of governance practitioners in and from marginalized communities. We will carry out the development of Modpol in close collaboration with the wider Metagov network.

Our primary goal is to address the issue of unwarranted polarization in decision-making processes and promote a more empathetic, transparent, and constructive governance model. Through research, development, testing, and community engagement, we aim to integrate Neutrosophy into decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and collaborative initiatives, fostering better decision-making and enhancing the overall governance experience.

## Introduction:
We are excited to introduce our project aimed at revolutionizing governance practices in the Web3 community. Traditional DAO governance often employs polarizing voting mechanisms, resulting in oversimplified binary choices that fail to capture the complexity of real-world decisions. Neutrosophy, a groundbreaking mathematical framework, offers a solution by accommodating nuanced opinions and uncertainties, facilitating more comprehensive decision-making.

## Problem Statement:
Current governance methods inherited by DAOs, influenced by binary mathematical logics, contribute to divisive decision-making processes. This binary approach oversimplifies choices and fails to represent the diverse range of opinions and uncertainties that real-world issues entail.

In real life, people face situations where the available information is insufficient and cause indecision, making it hard to vote ‚ÄúFor‚Äù, or ‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù. In other situations, people can simultaneously partially agree, disagree and be undecided regarding a proposal. These situations are not contemplated with polarizing voting mechanisms. Consequently, a more advanced mathematical logic is needed to address these limitations and promote a more inclusive and empathetic governance model.
# Introducing Neutrosophy
 
Neutrosophy explicitly and intentionally allows us to deal with the mentioned situations among others with solid theoretical foundations and methods. With the support of Prof. [Florentin Smarandache](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmrQsSwAAAAJ) (Neutrosophy‚Äôs creator), we will be exploring different neutrosophic methods to apply in DAOs governance.

## What We Have Achieved So Far:
In our journey towards implementing Neutrosophy-based governance, we have accomplished significant milestones:

### CODE
We published [**NeutrosophyLib**](https://github.com/SatisfiedVagabonds/NeutrosophyLib), a Solidity library containing basic neutrosophic operations.

![screenshot neutrosophylib](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F3N1oSUXwAIOiKY?format=png ""screenshot neutrosophylib"")

> You can explore here [NeutrosohpyLib Basic Operations](https://github.com/SatisfiedVagabonds/NeutrosophyLib/blob/master/NeutrosophyLib_basic_operations_v1.pdf)

### ARTICLES
After months of research, we published **two articles** on Medium:

> **June 2023:** [‚ÄúHow can the math of ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know if‚Ä¶‚Äô help improve the Democratic Deliberative Process?‚Äù](https://medium.com/@ranulfo17/how-can-the-math-of-i-dont-know-if-help-improve-the-democratic-deliberative-process-d59d0bef0945)
>
>From the article: _‚ÄúHowever, it is important to acknowledge that the Democratic Deliberative Process is not without its challenges. One aspect that often goes unnoticed is the mathematical limitations inherent in traditional deliberative processes. Our decision-making processes in politics, business, and even on a personal level are heavily influenced by Boolean mathematics, which revolves around binary choices of ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or opposing poles. While this simplification can be helpful, it also leads to a loss of valuable information and the inability to express opinions as a nuanced spectrum. Boolean mathematics forces us to choose a single option, even when our stance on complex issues may not align entirely with either extreme of ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù_

> **July 2023:** [‚ÄúNeutrosophy as a tool to navigate a hybrid convex-concave world‚Äù](https://medium.com/@ranulfo17/neutrosophy-as-a-tool-to-navigate-a-hybrid-convex-concave-world-50a3f1c9b3ff)
>
>From the article: _‚ÄúThe purpose of this text is to introduce Neutrosophy as a tool to help us navigate a hybrid multidimensional convex-concave world. By navigating we mean making better decisions and/or expressing our opinions in the complex, messy contexts that sometimes we face. It also briefly introduces NeutrosophyLib, a Solidity library containing basic neutrosophic operations for those interested in exploring these ideas.‚Äù_


### EVENTS
We presented our ideas during the Cripto Cantina ReFi event in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, and received positive feedback.

Ranulfo presented **‚ÄúNeutrosophy for the Empathetic Governance in DAOs and Collaborative Businesses‚Äù** to a group of +20 blockchain entrepreneurs, developers, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Project Solution:
Our project seeks to leverage Neutrosophy as a tool to enhance governance within DAOs and collaborative initiatives. Neutrosophy's ability to address complex decision scenarios, partial agreements, and uncertainties aligns perfectly with the multifaceted nature of decentralized communities. With the guidance of Prof. [Florentin Smarandache](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmrQsSwAAAAJ), the creator of Neutrosophy, we will explore and implement various neutrosophic methods to improve decision-making processes.

## Project Objectives:
Our key objectives for this project include:

1. **Selection of Optimal Neutrosophic Method:** Identify and adapt a suitable neutrosophic method to support decentralized governance, starting with a voting proposal.
2. **Testing and Feedback:** Test the chosen method in collaboration with Web3 initiatives such as [Cofiblocks.com](https://www.cofiblocks.com/), [Refi Costa Rica](https://linktr.ee/reficostarica), and [Diamante Bridge Collective](https://www.diamantebridge.org), gathering valuable feedback.
3. **Community Engagement:** Present Neutrosophy's potential for governance improvement through virtual and/or in-person sessions across Costa Rica, Argentina, and Brazil, receiving input from the Ethereum and EVM community.
4. **Development of NeutrosophyLib:** Enhance the Solidity NeutrosophyLib with additional functionalities and improvements based on practical application.
5. **Knowledge Dissemination:** Publish three blog posts and at least one scientific paper detailing our experiences and findings. Participate in relevant podcasts to share insights.

Decentraplace is a new web3 platform that makes it possible to collaborate on pixel art NFTs. Utilizing smart contracts, Decentraplace tokenizes the concept of r/Place and creates an investment product around this seemingly simple concept.

Decentraplace is a mix between an ERC20 token (PLACE) and an ERC1155 collection (NFT collection). PLACE tokens are used to burn in order to color on-chain pixels on decentraplace.io. This creates a deflationary mechanism for the PLACE token, as the more people use the platform, the more PLACE tokens are burned and removed from the supply.

To further incentivize activity, Decentraplace rewards users with NFTs for burning PLACE tokens. These NFTs can be used to boost PLACE staking APY by up to 10% per NFT. The more NFTs a user has, the higher their APY will be and no need to deposit the NFT. We also added new features like a OnChain Messenger and a new DeFi gamemode. 
Our 3 gamemodes are called OnChainInk, PhantomMessenger & LuckyEleven. 
OnchainInk is the best choice for users who are looking for a traditional pixel art experience with a focus on permanence and artistic expression. LuckyEleven is the better choice for users who are looking for a fast-paced and rewarding experience. PhantomMessages is the best choice for users who are looking for a unique and innovative way to communicate and interact with others on the blockchain.

Decentraplace is still in its early stages of development, but it has already attracted over 200 beta testers and ensured flawless functionality since April 2023. The project has successfully completed a total of 6 testNFT snapshots on the Sepolia Testnet, and is now preparing for the first stage of the mainnet launch: Tokenless.

Roadmap

Launch tokenless version: Decentraplace will launch as a tokenless platform to allow users to experience a extremely simplified version of the onchain pixelart platform. This will lower the barrier to entry and demonstrate the core solution that we offer: Permanent, Collaborative Art. 

Genesis NFT launch: Decentraplace will launch a Genesis NFT collection to reward early users and supporters.
DAO launch: Decentraplace will launch a DAO to give holders governance over the protocol and fine tune the Token design pre-Token launch.

Token launch: Decentraplace will launch its token, PLACE, once the DAO is in place and the protocol is fully developed.

Why Gitcoin?

Gitcoin is a great platform for Decentraplace to raise funding because it is aligned with our values of decentralization and open source development. We believe that Gitcoin is the best way to reach a community of users and supporters who are passionate about building the future of Web3.

Why is Decentraplace a good fit for the Mask Network ""Web3 Social""-Gitcoin grant?

Decentraplace is a community-driven project that is committed to building the future of web3. We are passionate about creating a platform that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

Decentraplace is also a deflationary project, which means that it is not susceptible to the same inflationary pressures as other cryptocurrencies. This makes it a good investment opportunity for those who are looking for a long-term hold.

Message from the Founder

As a solo founder, I am excited to apply for a Gitcoin grant to support the development of Decentraplace, a promising new web3 project. 
My goal with the grant money is to hire marketers,advisors and strategic partners to help launch and grow the project. Additionally AMA's will be organized I believe that this investment will be essential to achieving my goal of making Decentraplace a leading web3 platform.

I will measure the success of Decentraplace by tracking the following metrics:

Number of active users
Total transaction volume
Number of unique projects launched on Decentraplace
Number of partnerships established with other web3 projects
I believe that these metrics will provide a good indication of whether Decentraplace is achieving its goal of becoming a leading web3 platform.

I am confident that Decentraplace is a worthy project of your support, and I look forward to working with the Gitcoin community to make it a success.

This grant proposes researching governance frameworks for a scientific publishing protocol that is phased into open source ecosystem.  

We currently have a proposal in to NSF (the National Science Foundation) for just such a feasibility study.  That grant is pending so this grant would help us kickstart the process of exploratory research of how a DAO-like structure can be used to govern a blockchain based scientific research publishing protocol. 

The protocol we are using as the research artifact is **Frontier Registry**, our publishing protocol built on the blockchain and released so far in Alpha on test net.  As this protocol develops further we would like to explore responsible and ethical ways of transitioning it to user-owned aka exit-to-community. 



**Two Main Focus Areas** 

We are building Frontier Registry as research infrastructure to support global researchers in their publishing efforts and also as a way to provide more open access to published work, while still protecting authors‚Äô rights. The UX/UI is designed as user-friendly as possible so that non-blockchain users can easily use the protocol. So one major component of the research scoping phase is determining whether user-agency in this respect is wanted or welcomed. 

The second main component in this exploratory research scoping phase is to to see how we can responsibly and ethically transition to a user governance structure in this context of science. As we‚Äôve seen thus far in the token-based voting structures of DAOs, there can be unequal weight between users‚Äô governance rights. We feel this is highly inappropriate in the context of scientific research and peer review publishing. So we are eager to explore and experiment with other governance structures besides token-weighted voting. The aim is to provide full agency and governance to the publishing protocol users without risking concentration of power in a subset or subgroup of users. 



**We propose a 3 month scoping research phase to explore these components. I will keep the same team that we have assembled for our NSF grant proposal. The team comes from the startup world, an NGO, scientific research, DAO executive leadership and developer relations.**






**The Hows of Contributing to A DAO**

We are also prepping for informal webinars focused on DAOs, blockchain and fusion energy that are structured more like AMAs (ask me anythings) than courses or formal presentations. 

Informed communities are vital. And we are aiming for our FrontierDAO community members to be the most well-informed citizenry as possible about How to DAO. 

This grant is also intended for more general research into different methods and strategies for DAO governance. This past year, our executive members have joined several DAOs to learn and glean best practices. We would like to develop a more bespoke DAO governance system for our community that relies more on reputation-based voting rights. Support from this grant is intended for use in that exploratory scoping phase.

Help me to undertake a book project!

This book builds on years qualitative research to develop the concept of ""self-infrastructuring"" (see: https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517231159002) into a widely accessible, narrative style novel.

This book will make a seminal contribution by detailing the practices of ‚Äúself-infrastructuring‚Äù as the means by which how groups of people self-organise and govern via decentralised technologies. 

By showing the affordances and limitations of blockchain, ‚ÄúDecentralised Autonomous Organisations‚Äù, decentralised data management protocols, markets, and, governance, Open Hardware, and AI governance, it will be an important resource for Web3 practitioners and newcomers alike. 

It will also provide a rich, ethnographic contribution by detailing the dynamics of self-governance in decentralised technology communities to support more resilient governance and operational practices in decentralised technology communities. 

HOW FUNDS WILL BE USED: 

Funds will be used to produce artefacts related to the book project (i.e. highly accessible summaries, online seminars, recorded videos, graphics, and opensource book if possible although this can be very expensive if self-funded)

ABOUT ME:

I make significant effort to ensure my research efforts are made open and accessible. I have a track-record of high-quality opensource and governance research contributions (see: https://substack.com/@kelsienabben ; kelsien.github.io/ ; https://github.com/kelsien/datagovernancepatterns)

We think Zuzaluans, web3 pioneers, and anyone interested in decentralization and in network states should learn about this. During the coordination week at Zuzalu, it was a focus but didn't have actual contact or direct experience, so we want to go and make those bridges.

### Some goals:

Show what decentralized communities can look like by reviewing democratic confederalism as a model for stateless governance, autonomous cities, or network states. Is there something Zuzalians can learn from Rojava? There‚Äôs not enough in writing to do this research from afar. We need to go in person.

Create new connections between web3 and entrepreneurs in Rojava, to help seed new web3 projects that will help the Syrian people, introduce new people to this community, and increase the diversity of voices in web3.

Create writings and videos documenting daily life in the autonomous region under this libertarian, cooperative-based system. We plan to speak to Arab, Kurdish, and minority communities, and with local political leaders and entrepreneurs. Hardly any cultural reporting on Rojava has been done for English audiences since the pandemic and we think the world needs to hear Rojavan voices.

Please help us make this a reality by contributing, or by joining us on this adventure! We love taking people along on our projects and having fun while contributing to the world and to human knowledge.

We plan to present findings for this at next Zuzalu with actual on the ground experience and host simulations of this form of governance.

Bij√Æ Rojava!

To do so, it will analyze the lessons learned from the first pilot of Citizens' Assembly in Web3, and aligns with the set of questions proposed by the ground breaking article ""open problems in DAOS"".  

It will take two case studies as experimentation fields: Arbitrum Governance (also reflecting on the process since launch and the bottlenecks in governance there) and Uniswap (reflecting on the longer experience and adjustements since the airdrop). 

#Context: Governance for the 21st Century#

As Humanity dives into a new paradigm, there is a profound need to reassess the way we take collective decisions. Activists, academics, and practitioners worldwide have been planting seeds of new ways of doing exactly this. 3 emergent practices and approaches are particularly interesting to explore: Deliberative Governance, Web3, and the regenerative mindset.

As blockchain technology and crypto-related ecosystems grow, they are demonstrating the potential they have to change the world. If we look at governance, DAOs have very strong potential in terms of immutability, transparency, scalability, and incentive structures. At the same time, the challenges they face are also becoming clear. Particularly, decentralized governance has reached a clear bottleneck: crypto governance is plagued by low participation and turnout, bad quality forum discussions, nepotism, collusion, influencer biases, etc. This in itself is not dramatic as DAOs are a very new institution and there needs to be a lot of piloting and experimentation to find the right balance between old and new institutional designs, between soft and hard governance, and between social and onchain consensus.

Deliberative Governance has been invented, piloted and scaled since roughly 40 years as an answer and complement to the shortcomings of classical representative democracy and direct democracy. It brings collective intelligence (vs collected intelligence from voting, opinion polls or current crypto governance) to fruition, is epistemically strong (through cognitive diversity and the methods used in the process) and highly legitimate (through random selection of participants also known as Aleatorian Democracy). An overview of the many faces of deliberation can be explored at (https://participedia.net/).¬†

These 2 approaches have a clear potential to test and scale a new way of taking collective decisions as long as we are able to approach them in the more general framework of the regenerative approach manifesting through 4 principles: open network (nested, in relationships), regenerative (homeostasis: structure resilience & auto-poiesis: evolution), creative (emergent properties), intelligent (learning loops, cognition: adaptation to perturbations).

#State of the art and approach#

There is a flourishing activity in research and experimentation in DAOs governance, deliberative governance and regenerative activity. But there is a lack of understanding in how exactly those 3 components interact. The goal of the research is to propose a framework for grasping the intersection of the three worlds and a series of possible experimentation to test the framework. It aims at responding to the call launched through  the ground breaking paper ‚ÄúOpen problems in DAOs‚Äù  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19201.pdf). Particularly, it aims at contributing to part 7 of the discussion. 

The approach aims at being practice oriented and experimentation oriented. It builds on a series of exploratory discussions (https://archive.org/details/vergne-metagov) and a first pilot in the Web3 ecosystem: The Cosmos Citizens‚Äô Assembly (see: https://aez.global/  and https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-after-the-big-bang-a-constitutional-process-the-cosmos-hub/8695 ). 

#output#

The output of the research will be a paper titled ‚Äúdecision legos‚Äù that will be organized along the following structure: (1) a metalevel approach on decision-making, (2) the proposition of a framework for thinking about future proof polities, (3) an operationalization for how a future-proof decision making set of decision legos could look like. 

It will be based on a multidisciplinary, ‚Äúfuzzy logic‚Äù approach (Cintula et al. 2021; Zadeh 1975). It will also be inspired by a long-term ethnographic approach as the author has been involved in both the field of aleatorian democracy (since 1998), deliberative democracy (since 2003) and the crypto/blockchain ecosystem (since 2011). The paper will also reflect on the first pilots in the Cosmos Ecosystem.  

The paper will have a specific focus on Arbitrum and Uniswap as case studies both for reflection and for the design of a future proof set of decision legos.

The DeSci Landscape Analysis is the first multidisciplinary research group dedicated to in-depth analysis of the DeSci Space. Support will go towards our current focus of researching leadership and governance  structures within DeSci DAOs. 
Phase 1 (completed) analyzed the impact Gitcoin Round 15 crowdfunding had on the DeSci ecosystem. 

Phase 2 (current focus) expands our work to all DeSci DAOs and is focused on mapping out governance, leadership, operations, technological, community, and funding functions. 

Phase 3+ (future focuses) will build off of our current work to explore more specific social data, DAO growth trends, and other aspects desired by the DeSci community. 

For further elaboration on our work: 
Phase I - completed 
The results of a survey from talentDAO and DeSciWorld shed light on the impact Gitcoin Round 15 crowdfunding can have on decentralized science (DeSci) organizations and ecosystem development. We explored what these projects are and what they achieved using the funds received.
Check the results here: https://mirror.xyz/erinmagennis.eth/rSAHHVavkVHVqrKsp9C0w-GScJzKcJMnGxYBw0IrQUg
This was the first phase of the DeSci Landscape Analysis, which aims to understand what the decentralized science movement is and what impact it has in the scientific ecosystem. In further phases of this study, we plan to expand these efforts to uplift the DeSci ecosystem.

Phase II - current focus 
Right now we are focusing on phase II where we'll survey as many DeSci projects as possible to create a new ecosystem map. We'll also pull data from Twitter API to understand how these projects -and their followers- relate to each other. Our analysis will include:

Network analysis üåê
Project clusters üî†
Sociodemographic data üë§

If successful, we could allow cross-pollination between projects and attract new students and researchers to the decentralized science ecosystem. All results will be published accessible to everyone so we can include new voices to further discussions about DeSci.
In GR18 we got enough funds to cover our operational costs (thank you all ‚ù§Ô∏è). The funds we raise in this round will be used for publishing and promotion of this study in events like science congresses or web3 events.

We are B Labs, an innovation hub supporting promising Web3 projects, developing **Realms**. Realms is a community management tool that makes your community more productive.


### What we are about
We are creating a system that supports DAOs as well as other member based groups . We aim to make governance simple, scalable and improve the coordination and decision making in groups. We are especially interested in giving groups the ability to launch and incubate sub-organizations in order to improve decision making for the whole community.

We think the concepts in Realms are universally applicable and therefore useful in different scenarios such as identifying productive members, reaching both large and small decisions quickly, and offering a simple way to scale the community and number of projects being worked on simultaneously. 


### How does Realms work
Realms is a Discord bot that allows you to create a new ‚Äúrealm‚Äù for each channel in your server.  These realms each have their own governance tools, which consist of a unique ‚Äúcoin‚Äù ( analogous to a token ), a coin distribution strategy called ‚Äúfair distribution‚Äù  which allows your entire community to participate in coin distribution, and finally a versatile voting system which allows you to play with incentives around vote participation.


 ### How we can help communities
We ant to explore the different ways that Realms and other projects can collaborate to utilize their respective strengths to their full potential. We are also interested in exploring the decision making processes within a community and optimizing them by researching voting as well as decision making patterns.

We are currently in closed beta, but if you are interested in a Realms demo or want to discuss in more detail, feel free to contact us by joining our Discord and pinging us there. You can find the link in Gitbook  below.

## Project Description

The Distributed Governance Score Framework (DGSF) project is developing an open and participatory framework to re-define how organizations assess their alignment with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). At the heart of the DGSF project lies our tool, the DAO Index. 

The key features of the DAO Index include:

- **Standardized Principles**: Offering a unified set of principles and language, DGSF enables clear measurement and reporting of an organization's alignment with DAO models.
- **Questionnaire**: As a practical application of DGSF, the DAO Index operationalizes these principles into a user-friendly tool, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world implementation of decentralized governance.

## The Challenge: Addressing the Transparency Poverty in DAOs

As interest in DAOs continues to rise, two critical gaps have become increasingly apparent ‚Äî a gap in transparency and conceptual clarity. This issue, which we term ""Transparency Poverty,"" poses a significant threat to the credibility and operational effectiveness of DAOs. The primary challenges contributing to this gap are:

1. **Insufficient Tools for Transparency**: There is a noticeable lack of comprehensive tools capable of providing clear, transparent operations  within DAOs. This void hinders both the internal efficiency of DAOs and the public's ability to fully comprehend their mechanisms.
2. **Lack of Comprehensive DAO Practices Repository**: The DAO ecosystem is currently missing a centralized, well-curated repository that documents the spectrum of practices ‚Äî both exemplary and suboptimal ‚Äî within various DAOs. Such a resource is essential for learning, adaptation, and the avoidance of past pitfalls.
3. **Conceptual Misunderstandings**: Across various sectors, including academia, industry, and society at large, there exists a significant gap in the fundamental understanding of what DAOs are and how they  function. This lack of understanding stifles informed discussion, research, and development in the field.
4. **The Imaginary-Reality Gap**: There is a stark contrast between the idealized vision of what DAOs promise to be and what they are in practice. This gap between theory and reality ‚Äî the ""imaginary-reality gap"" ‚Äî leads to misconceptions about the capabilities and limitations of DAOs, affecting stakeholder expectations and trust.

Addressing these challenges is vital for the advancement and sustainability of DAOs. By acknowledging and tackling these issues, we aim to contribute to the maturation and legitimization of the DAOs.

## Research Questions 

Our primary research question is how can we develop a standard and measurement tool to rate and benchmark DAO design features and governance processes, given the themes and sociotechnical imaginaries associated with DAOs?

Our secondary research questions include:

1. How to define a DAO?;
2. What are the sociotechnical imaginaries associated with DAOs?; and
3. What are appropriate themes and organizing principles to bound DAOs practically?

## Solution: Benchmarking DAO Design and Governance


To address these issues, we introduce the DAO Index, a set of organizing principles (eight as of Version 0.9), operationalized through a questionnaire, to revolutionize how organizational alignment with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are evaluated and benchmarked.

The current organizing principles are:

1. Cross-border Coordination,
2. Broad Stakeholder Participation,
3. Practicing DAO Cooperativism,
4. Cultural Patterns and Brand,
5. Organizational Technology,
6. Human-centered Algorithmic Governance,
7. Information and Data Transparency, and
8. DAO-2-DAO.

Through the DAO Index, we create a score expressing an organization's alignment with the DAO conceptualization, culminated in an easy-to-understand score and rating label.


The key benefits of the DAO Index include:

- **Rigorous Questionnaire for In-Depth Assessment**: The DAO Index is operationalized through a carefully developed questionnaire (currently at Version 0.9), which is the cornerstone of our assessment methodology. This tool is engineered to measure a DAO's alignment with the ideal DAO conceptualization, encompassing a wide array of governance and operational aspects.
- **Integration of On- and Off-Chain Data**: Our approach is unique in its comprehensive integration of both on- and off-chain data, primarily through quantitative analysis of on-chain data, and a qualitative analysis of off-chain governance and other organizational practices. This dual-pronged strategy ensures a holistic evaluation, capturing the full spectrum of DAO organizational design and governance models.
- **Creating a Benchmark for DAOs**: By establishing a clear and robust assessment method, the DAO Index sets a new standard in the DAO community. It provides a quantifiable and qualitative benchmark against which DAOs can be evaluated, encouraging transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.
- **Facilitating Comparative Analysis**: With the DAO Index, stakeholders can compare DAOs of varying sizes and focuses on a level playing field. This comparative analysis is crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions, whether for investment, collaboration, or research purposes.

In essence, the DAO Index is not just a tool for assessment; it's a comprehensive solution that brings clarity, standardization, and insightful analysis to the DAO ecosystem. It aims to bridge the gap between the theoretical ideals of DAOs and their practical implementations, thus contributing significantly to the advancement of decentralized governance.

## DAO Index Assessment Process

The DAO Index assessment is a meticulous six-step procedure designed to ensure accuracy, transparency, and active participation from the DAO community. The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Initial Draft Assessment**: Utilizing the DAO Index Questionnaire, we conduct an initial assessment based on publicly available information about a DAO. This stage forms the foundation of our analysis.
2. **Draft Publication**: The initial assessment findings are then published on the DAO Index Dashboard. Additionally, a comprehensive write-up detailing this preliminary evaluation is made available for public viewing and feedback.
3. **Community Engagement**: In this critical phase, we actively engage with representatives from the DAO under review. Their insights and feedback on both the DAO Index and the draft assessment are solicited to ensure a well-rounded evaluation.
4. **Final Assessment Compilation**: The final assessment integrates feedback received in the previous step. It also considers any new information or developments that have emerged since the initial assessment, ensuring the final report is up-to-date and reflective of the latest DAO dynamics.
5. **Final Assessment Dissemination**: Similar to the draft stage, the final assessment is published on the DAO Index Dashboard for transparency. A detailed write-up, encompassing all the insights and conclusions from the entire assessment process, is also made publicly available.
6. **Ongoing Review Cycle**: Recognizing the dynamic nature of DAOs, this step involves revisiting and reassessing DAOs periodically. This iterative approach ensures that the DAO Index remains relevant and accurately reflects the evolving landscape of DAO governance.

## Use-cases

Three possible use-cases for the DAO Index include: 

1) research and analysis of DAOs with the DAO Index data repository (assessments, scores, evidence-base, etc.), 
2) rating labels and badges as easily understandable indicators of DAO Index scores, and 
3) highlighting and sharing DAO (good and bad) practices with DAO operators and the public

In recent years, there has been growing interest among blockchain communities‚Äîfrom those surrounding DAOs to entire public blockchain protocols‚Äîto ‚Äòconstitutionalise‚Äô their governance through the drafting and proposal of constitutions, covenants, codes of conduct, etc. This can broadly be seen as an effort by these communities to articulate their values, anchor their purpose as their governance is decentarlized and, to a degree, respond to various criticisms about their governance (e.g., rule by a shadowy elite). The language of constitutions has been intuitively appealing to some communities due to the association of the term with the production and management of public goods, and their explicitly political character. However, what has been lacking is a thorough and systematic understanding of the implications of constitutionalisation. 

For a constitution to be an effective governance tool, it needs to be structured to fit its purpose and context. Consequently, developing such a systematic understanding is important to help projects evaluate the impact of constitutionalizing both from a legal and historical perspective as well as from an operational point of view. 

**What we‚Äôre doing**
This proposed project draws on existing theories and concepts on constitutionalisation to collaboratively develop governance principles for blockchain communities and evaluate these principles with pilot communities. 

Two overarching questions guide our work:

1. When and why does it make sense for blockchain communities to constitutionalize?
2. How should blockchain communities structure their constitutions (in terms of substance) and the constitutionalization process to maximize legitimacy in the outcome? 

**How we‚Äôre doing it**
We‚Äôve already conducted an extensive literature analysis and gathered input and feedback through an international academic conference dedicated to the topic in June 2023. Our findings are published in this [report](https://blockchaingov.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EUI-Conference-June-2023-FINAL.pdf). In the next phase of our research we want to deepen our empirical research by conducting an in-depth analysis of existing constitutions including those of Optimism and Arbitrum, and begin testing some of our guidelines and best practices with selected pilot communities. 

**Targeted outputs and impact**
As an academic research project we will be publishing our insights and findings in a series of open access research reports and papers. The Gitcoin grant will help us to develop more supplementary materials for the practitioner community, including a ‚ÄúConstitution Cookbook‚Äù where we detail guidelines on various flavors of blockchain constitutionalism in an accessible manner as well as accompanying material such as blog posts, templates and public talks. 

Together these resources aim to help communities constitutionalize in an effective and legitimate manner. 

**Who we are**
We are all part of the [BlockchainGov ERC](https://blockchaingov.eu/) Project. BlockchainGov is a 5-year long (2021-2026) transdisciplinary [European Research Council (ERC)](https://erc.europa.eu/homepage) research project, based as [CERSA|CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) and the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/home), aimed at restoring trust in institutions at the community and global levels, by promoting better on-chain and off-chain distributed governance practices. The project is led by Dr. Primavera de Filippi and is supported by a team of postdoctoral and doctoral researchers, as well as external academic collaborators across the globe.

As the decentralized space continues to grow, the increasing prevalence of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) has led to a rising demand for effective and transparent dispute resolution mechanisms.

The primary objective of this research is to provide a clear and detailed understanding of the various dispute resolution platforms operating on Ethereum. The initiative will investigate the mechanisms employed by these platforms, assessing their strengths, weaknesses, and unique features. This research will extend from decentralized on-chain arbitration systems to more traditional off-chain models, encompassing a broader spectrum of dispute resolution strategies in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Anticipated Outcome:

We aim to produce a comprehensive map that highlights the diversity and functionality of Ethereum dispute resolution platforms. This map will serve as a valuable resource for developers, stakeholders, and the broader Ethereum community, providing insights into the array of options available for addressing disputes within the decentralized ecosystem. The goal is to enhance understanding of the tools available to ensure fairness, justice, and efficiency in the decentralized space.

How? 

To achieve these objectives, the research initiative will employ a multi-faceted approach:

Comprehensive Review: Conduct an exhaustive review of existing literature, whitepapers, and documentation related to dispute resolution platforms on Ethereum.

Platform Analysis: Evaluate the mechanisms, strengths, weaknesses, and unique features of diverse dispute resolution platforms, covering both on-chain and off-chain models.

Case Studies: Examine real-world case studies and examples of dispute resolution instances within the Ethereum ecosystem to gain practical insights.

Stakeholder Interviews: Engage with developers, users, and stakeholders involved in Ethereum dispute resolution platforms to gather firsthand experiences and perspectives.

Data Compilation: Systematically compile and categorize the gathered information to create a comprehensive map detailing the different dispute resolution platforms.

Report Generation: Summarize the findings in a detailed report, highlighting key patterns, trends, and recommendations for developers, stakeholders, and the Ethereum community.

# üåé About Commons Stack

Commons Stack innovates at the intersection between culture and token engineering.

We build open-source technical tools and cultural frameworks that enable impact initiatives to evolve into decentralized, regenerative, self-governing communities. Our expertise lies in guiding communities through the process of creating an organizational structure that facilitates active participation, cooperation, and accountability. You can build a community-driven ecosystem that fosters positive change and ensures your project‚Äôs long-term success.

These four pillars present our approach to funding, governance, and public goods management:

**Cultural frameworks:**  We provide comprehensive cultural frameworks that empower impact-focused communities to form, fundraise, and govern effectively, ensuring their long-term success. These frameworks are designed to accommodate the unique needs and challenges of DAOs, offering flexible, research-based solutions that respect both collective and individual autonomy.

**Economics Co-design:** We champion Economic Co-design, a methodology that promotes inclusion, transparency, and active participation, enabling community members to create their own economic design proposals. This ensures diverse perspectives are heard, fostering the growth of innovative and practical solutions tailored to community needs through a 3-step process: educate, propose, and vote.

**Research:** We conduct research to innovate collective governance and economic design tools for web3. Our research-led approach allows us to create adaptable templates that cater to the unique needs of diverse communities.

**Library of Tools:** We curate a library of tools, comprised of modular, interoperable solutions that empower communities to fund projects and establish regenerative token economies. These tools, including the Augmented Bonding Curve and Conviction Voting, facilitate the launch of CommonsDAO and complement the creation of a sustainable, polycentric governance model.

To enable more communities to launch and interact with their own ABC, we have recently rolled out the [ABC Launch](https://launch.abcswap.xyz/) and [ABC Swap](https://abcswap.xyz/) MVP.

The ABC Launch dapp enables individuals and projects to create an Aragon DAO and deploy their own Augmented Bonding Curve. It offers customization options for parameters such as opening price, reserve collateral and entry/exit tributes, empowering projects to create DAO-owned liquidity and unique microeconomies. The ABC Swap facilitates swapping of tokens launched and governed by ABCs.

# ü§ù Our Commitment to Open Source

Open source fosters a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual respect. It gives builders worldwide access to tools and resources that collectively drive research and social and technological advancements.

We champion a culture of radical openness as we believe transparency advances projects and productivity ethically and inclusively. We actively practice the philosophy of open source by building in public. 


# üåüOur History of Success

We launched the first Augmented Bonding Curve for the Token Engineering Commons in 2021, and [$TEC has maintained parity with ETH in a bear market](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipSAI5M1Yo_nWEgfxMfY5n_lGq6SFrog/edit#gid=1569207494) (only down ~15% vs ETH) while the ABC collected $300k via swapping fees for TE Public Goods. This economic model is a significant milestone towards ""Impact = Profit"".

In 2023, we deployed Aragon OS & our CommonsDAO tools such as Tao Voting and ABC to Optimism. Tao Voting features Delegation and ""Wait for Quiet"" to prevent last-minute vote manipulation. ABCswap.xyz enables communities to launch and interact with their own ABC, providing a no-code solution to launch economic systems like friend.tech.

Our Conviction Voting model has been adopted by notable projects like Gitcoin, Giveth, TEC, 1Hive, BrightID, and more.


# üéØ What's Next with the Funding

We‚Äôve been in pursuit of more funding to expand the reach of our CommonsDAO tooling, including the Augmented Bonding Curve, Tao Voting and Conviction Voting. After the successful launch of the ABC Launch and ABC Swap MVP, our goal is to extend our CommonsDAO tooling to more networks and communities. This means more public good projects gaining access to our innovative tools and ability to launch an ABC to fund and govern their missions, empowering them to create sustainable token economies and effective governance models. We‚Äôre also currently working on the next versions of ABC Launch and ABC Swap and planning for future releases. Furthermore, extra funding will enable us to continue our research with Augmented Bonding Curves.

In addition to supporting our specific projects, the funding from GG19 will provide a much-needed boost to our overall operations, particularly in navigating the challenges of the bear market. üêª  We believe in the resilience and potential of the Commons Stack community, and with your support, we can continue to innovate and drive impact, regardless of market conditions.

Pairwise is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, like a dating app, allowing users to choose between pairs of options to signal their preferences as opposed to having to read endless forum posts and vote within a set time period. The system converts these simple subjective inputs into objective, measurable outputs, minimizing the cost and cognitive burden of voting.

## How does it work?

Pairwise started as a seed of an idea from the [big brain algorithm research out of Colony back in 2018](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/). Pairwise is a decentralized voting dapp that aims to make it easier for Web3 communities to signal their preferences and make informed decisions. Pairwise is implemented as a website with its own front end and an open-source backend. Pairwise voting will be compatible with all EVM chains and development is fully open source.

One of the biggest problems in DAOs is lack of engagement in governance processes. The goal of the project is to improve the decision-making process by providing a valuable alternative to traditional voting systems and promoting community engagement in the decision-making process. We are confident that this project has the potential to make a significant impact as a public good and we look forward to the opportunity to bring Pairwise voting to life with your support.

## How does it support Public Goods?

The mission of Pairwise is to be a public good itself (by being free & open source), and by supporting decision making within public good DAOs and projects. It is non-excludable (anyone can use it for free) and non rivalrous (it can work alongside any other governance tool).

![|602x320](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DxDwtj3rHx-EsC87ETeVk4IrNgChTBAN5K9FIhDPwYNVVk7u8uel8DeHsx96Xp967Cbex8wsvEF0IUCpFoJyalVvw8VzHTtfJK8YskSfIovrN1JrrX9PFENXq8in7Tmj5AVwXaF-aSAGJqaX8q1gbyY)Here are a few practical use case studies and specific examples of how Pairwise could benefit public goods in the web3 space:

**Grant Proposals:** Pairwise comparison helps organizations prioritize grant proposals by systematically comparing their potential impact and feasibility, ensuring more effective funding distribution. This is especially useful in cases where there are many projects or initiatives that are requesting funding (retroactive public goods, Gitcoin grants etc.).

**Decentralized Curation and Ranking:** Pairwise can be used to compare, rank and curate projects, content, products, or services, and can serve as a ‚Äúdecentralized suggestion algorithm‚Äù. One use case being explored is with Giveth, where users can vote on projects that they are passionate about, which would then feed into the website ranking. This not only allows the community to vote on what projects are important for them, but it also opens the door for new projects to surface that otherwise would have not received the same exposure.

**User research:** A fun use case is user research, where the community can be polled on what their subjective preferences are. For example, this can be used within any DAO to decide on features as kind of a ‚Äúhot or not‚Äù game, where users can vote on specific designs or traits, to determine which ones are most valued by the community.

**Progress**

**Video Demo**

We have a working demo and are doing our initial user testing with the Giveth Community.

**Differentiation (from other projects)**

Pairwise is similar to Snapshot, but with a specific type of UX. Snapshot votes are built around the expectation that users will go do research in forums and read long-form discussions. Our approach leans into the fact that most of the community isn‚Äôt even going to skim the forum posts and will vote with their gut. The goal is to give a clearer signal of what the community wants through more engagement in fun and simple micro-decisions.

Pairwise shouldn‚Äôt be used for EVERY decision, but we believe it is an important complement to the current voting applications that exist today.

At General Magic, we believe in the power of collaboration in the open-source world. That's why we would be thrilled if Snapshot chose to integrate Pairwise into their platform. However, even if Snapshot decides not to, we are still committed to deploying this feature independently and integrating Snapshot's strategies into our system. We believe that this will benefit the entire governance ecosystem as we work together to create more efficient methods based on algorithms.

We are actively pursuing funding to implement and empirically validate AI governance tools equipped with DAO mechanisms with decision-making mechanisms such as Plural quadratic voting. Our approach involves rigorous testing with end users to assess the effectiveness of  Democratic AI Governance tools and to assess the practicality of applying DAO/decentralized mechanisms in the context of AI governance. 

## Description

We are introducing InlcusiveAI, a platform initially tested with 235 users from underserved groups (global south, people with disability) and built to asses decentralized governance methods, particularly Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) mechanisms coupled with various voting methods (e.g., quadratic and plural quadratic voting), voting power distributions (equal or differential), and coordination mechanisms. We have already achieved novel results in  Phase 1 of this project with OpenAI as a part of the Democratic Input to AI Grant.  Since this is phase 1 of a research project originally funded by OpenAI, much research infrastructure and methodology have already been developed, meaning that we can put the requested funding to immediate use by producing high-quality, peer-reviewed governance research. Now, we will be working on the following research advances: 

1. Evaluation of governance mechanisms, plural QV
 
2. Lack of understanding of how pro-social behavior affects governance outcomes *in general*, not just for AI governance

3. Mechanisms to be run in the wild - providing more realistic outcomes

4. Improved Sample representation with proof-of-personhood to avoid distortion of outcomes

## Why this is important?

A concrete use case of recent public outcry over the integration of GPT-powered AI in Be My Eye has resulted in the removal of the image description feature when detecting human bodies or faces in images or videos. This decision was made by AI actors without involving blind users, who have long relied on this tool to manage their privacy of visual content in case of sharing in social media, friends/family, etc. This highlights the practical relevance of decentralized AI governance to address the existing power imbalances in technology design.

## More Details of the Project Outcome

1. First, implement a new voting method called **Plural Quadratic Voting** within the context of **AI governance**. Plural Quadratic Voting has shown promise as a socio-technical tool for fostering agreement among diverse groups of people. Testing plural QV in the context of AI governance will allow us to answer the following questions ‚Äì

-Does AI governance benefit when proposals with diverse bases of support are prioritized, and if so, how can we implement algorithms that effectively prioritize such projects? If not, what other insights can we gain to improve AI governance?

-Output: an empirically validated set of insights for understanding the use cases for plural QV and the strength of the improvements it brings to governance processes and outcomes. 

2. **Prosocial behavior** (or, the tendency of individuals to make decisions that benefit their social networks as well as themselves) has been shown to alter the outcomes of decision-making mechanisms. If ignored, prosocial effects can negatively impact outcomes by distorting a mechanism‚Äôs view of the world ‚Äì however, plural QV is uniquely suited to account for prosocial effects. 

-How do prosocial utilities/ prosocial behaviors manifest in the context of AI governance, and how can AI governance tools like plural QV use pro-social trends to improve the quality of governance outcomes? 

-Output: Experimenting with (and getting feedback from) different groups of underserved populations with preexisting social connections will allow us to rigorously explore how prosocial behavior manifests in practice and how AI governance tools can best support decision-making in this context. Prosocial behavior is a relatively under-studied area of economics, but understanding it is vital to calibrating effective governance mechanisms. Plural QF already shows promise as a mechanism well-suited for governance in the presence of prosocial behavior. 

--Output: Quality of Governance: Quantification of users‚Äô satisfaction towards this new voting method in the AI Governance context with measures from **political science**.

3. Run the experiment of InclusiveAI Iteration 2 in the wild taking a grassroots approach to facilitate crowdsourced reporting of unexpected AI model behaviors of real-world user experiences, and make proposed solutions publicly available for broader deliberation via a  community-driven red teaming approach.

-Output: A taxonomy for AI Governance with real-life reporting of AI model behavior issues faced by end users and possible solutions they look for.

4. To avoid issues related to representation, InclusiveAI will integrate primitives such as proof of personhood based on zero-knowledge proofs.

-Output: Result of its‚Äô applicability in real-world scenarios to verify legit participation, particularly when it comes to the decision-making process and voting power involved.

## Overall Output

1. **User satisfaction metrics**‚Äì are key to assessing the effectiveness of AI governance tools, because ultimately, users must be able to understand and interact with such tools for them to make any meaningful difference.

2. **Critical insights from underserved communities**, can significantly expand the domain of AI governance and push it in a more equitable direction ‚Äì considerations often overlooked in both academia and industry.

3. **A public repository** of user-reported AI issues ‚Äì and potential solutions can serve as a valuable resource for academic researchers looking into various challenges and for industry professionals seeking innovative solutions.

## Broader Impact

1. In the context of both AI and DAOs, discussions and public discourse often overlook underserved groups, particularly in the global south, where our team has several years of research outreach and built a trust relationship to easily embed and run these experiments. In addition, certain groups, like individuals with disabilities often early adopters of AI technology. This project can make a meaningful impact on these communities and make a bridge between AI governance and the DAO community.

2. The open-source nature of this project can foster a collaborative environment that encourages innovation and ongoing research agenda from the human-centered approach.

3. Our team uniquely combines expertise in DAO research, HCI, economics, and political science, enabling us to approach this project considering a broader landscape.

However, equally interesting is the property of autonomous operation. Smart contracts on an immutable substrate allow these digitally-constituted organizations to persist and operate completely independently, drawing comparisons to rudimentary artificial intelligence systems or even more complex structures like entire organisms. The analogy is apt, especially if one considers a more instinct-driven unit (e.g., an ant or a bee). Insofar as DAOs are, in fact, organism-like, we can say that they faithfully follow the instructions encoded into the DNA of their smart contracts. But they also fail to perform one of the most basic functions of substantially all other autonomous beings: death. When most other organisms outlive their usefulness or otherwise get outcompeted (or actively hunted by humans in an effort to shape an ecosystem), they die‚Äîeither entirely and go extinct, or sometimes just enough that they are forced to evolve. We don‚Äôt have a mechanism to forcefully wind up DAOs, but perhaps we should. This paper proposes research on a potential construction for ‚ÄúDAO Death,‚Äù either voluntarily or when a DAO gets outcompeted in the ecosystem.

# History
Operating for nearly two years since October 2021, our focus from late 2021 to 2022 was primarily on theoretical and case studies, centering on public goods and their self-governance. We organized a small group of 86, hosting 75 book clubs/research meetings. In early 2023, we shifted towards practical involvement, participating in the governance of NounsDAO. As of November 14, 2023, we have independently conducted due diligence on proposals numbered 237 to 438 and established a group of over 200 members. We hold a public governance research meeting weekly, totaling 47 sessions, where we share interesting points and lessons learned from the proposals, along with controversies, with the community.

# Philosophy
Our name, 'Protector,' reflects our role not as Protect Holders or Builders, but as protectors of the community's factual layer. We believe that in a well-ordered governance system, every value can be expressed, leading to a harmonious emergence of diversity. This necessitates a role that continually strives to present the community with the complex nature, rules, strengths, weaknesses, and value orientations underlying events, constantly restoring distorted facts.

# Plan
In 2024, we plan to continue what we have been doing every week over the past year:

- Research reports on proposals/events, aiming to help stakeholders affected by governance understand the complexities behind different proposals/events.
- Weekly governance meetings to maintain a fair forum, facilitating heuristic governance debates to provide participants with broader perspectives.
- Risk alerts for key proposals, taking responsibility to raise awareness and organize community alerts for proposals that severely distort or hide essential facts.
Unlike 2023, we will expand the scope of our governance research, moving from NounsDAO in the first quarter to include Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon.

# Rules
Our fundamental principle is to relinquish the right to vote in favor. We conduct responsible research and investigations into proposals, opposing only those that severely distort basic facts, like lies or hidden conflicts of interest. For regular value conflicts, we step back, turning to our routine work, like a workshop practicing the arts of research and governance. We adhere to a fixed rhythm, weekly studying different events/proposals, sharing with the community the different value positions and interests from our perspective, and importantly, the situations of the issues themselves and some intriguing aspects.

# Organizational Process
Before Monday: We complete basic research on the week's topic, forming a proposal research document.
Monday: In a pre-meeting, four members discuss all proposals, selecting two to three for discussion in Tuesday's governance meeting. The proposal sharing session focuses on the complexity behind the topics, or on exceptionally good ideas, to enlighten more people about the fascinating aspects of Crypto.
Tuesday: Governance meeting. This is an open meeting where members publicly debate the proposals.""",https://protector.notion.site/,bafkreifkgkbccfvtyz6mbenppmhsial6zquni64iqndzxqzx2acpuhknru,bafkreib25x73pfnr2wln6kg47naa3wbeeu77up7lbrmfsjdcyxclfvgwk4,NA,NA,NA,bafkreickwnkoza7aoilylfwynvvoladkonabsd7oflrfgxy2h4lwr7m6ge

ABOUT THIS GRANT

""üåâ Just as civil engineering lets people feel confident driving across a bridge without reading its blueprints, token engineering does the same for society's next critical infrastructure: crypto-economic systems. 

‚öôÔ∏è Token engineering provides the tools and processes to ensure that blockchain systems are safe, resilient, and trustworthy. This analytical rigor is crucial for building public trust and adoption of Web3 technologies. It's the essence of Web3 public good. ""  -Token Engineering Commons @tecmns
                     
The field of TE is incredibly important to bridge the gap of emerging and reliable tech to build sound digital public infrastructure. 

Funding education in the field is crucial to train more practitioners to meet the growing demands of rapid growth in the development of cryptoeconomic systems and new forms of digital organization.

I had the honor and opportunity to work on the first-ever free educational course in Token Engineering - TE Fundamentals - offered by the Token Engineering Academy. https://tokenengineering.net/

Working with TE Academy Founder Angela Kreitenweis and several other research colleagues, I created the governance module - condensing hundreds of videos, articles, and academic papers into a course and extensive library for open study. The work took 6+ months (and a lot of blood, sweat & tears) and it is still only scratching the surface of study.

If you haven't had a chance, I encourage you to check it and the other modules out:
https://tokenengineering.net/course/tef-module5/

I would like to repurpose the content into articles for easier and wider digestion for folks who may not have the time or interest to do an entire course, but are interested in selected topics, and create a more accessible bite-sized body of knowledge. 

In addition, I would love to refer anyone interested in contributing to the creation of educational TE materials, particularly in governance, to communities and channels working on various layers of study.

HOW YOUR DONATIONS WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS

Donations received will go towards hiring a writer(s)/editor(s) to support in the process. There was at one point a TE writer's guild who created incredible content, but due to a lack of funding, could not continue their valuable work. 

I will be sourcing support from that group, and although some of them would volunteer, I would love to be able to compensate them for their time in creating these highly valuable public goods.

d20 is a Discord bot that allows communities to play governance games in an LLM-mediated environment. Groups can come together to embark on a governance ‚Äúquest‚Äù and experience a diversity of governance structures, decision-making processes, power distributions, cultural dynamics and more.

d20 aims to help lay the collective decision-making foundations necessary for communities to conduct governance experiments, education, future scenario planning, and real-life decision-making while bonding communities through play.

# Background
d20 was built by a group of researchers from The Metagovernance Project, a nonprofit research collective aiming to empower online community self-governance. Whereas, currently, many of the most commonly used digital platforms limit communities to hierarchical admin-user models (‚Äú[implicit feudalism](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820986553)‚Äù), Metagov aims to promote alternative governance structures (‚Äú[modular politics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13701)‚Äù) through tools and resources such as PolicyKit, the Metagov Gateway, CommunityRule, and now d20 Governance.

Building on the work of our colleagues at Metagov, our team started out in 2022 by studying the challenges communities face when it comes to designing or evolving their governance structures and processes. With the growing trend towards self-governance on the internet, governance literature and tooling are abundant. However, there are few spaces for more hands-on learning about governance, experimentation, simulation, or even just play! This was how d20 was born.

Our goal with the d20 game is to create an environment where communities can learn not just basic governance vocabulary but also engage closely with these concepts through practice, gameplay, and interaction. We strive to give members of online communities hands-on experiences with alternative governance processes so that they can be more intentional about the way they design governance systems for their own context. 

# The d20 Experience
d20 currently has two game modes.

1. **Agora:** The agora empowers communities to asynchronously explore different decision-making methods, alter game settings, run one-off governance experiments, and engage with the features of the d20 bot.

2. **Build a Community:** The ‚ÄúBuild a Community‚Äù game is a ~25-min narrative-led quest where players are prompted to come together to establish themselves as a new group within the community. Each stage of the game bring players into contact with different decision-making methods, cultural environments, and governance structures .

In both modes, d20 influences the group's communication norms with ""culture modules‚Äù that use an LLM to modify the content of users' messages and temporarily place players in artificially constructed cultures. 

There are currently six culture modules:

- **Amplify:** Intensify the sentiment of original messages
- **Eloquence:** Beautify messages to be persuasive and Shakespearean
- **Obscurity:** Obscure messages to make them harder to read
- **Ritual:** Harmonize messages with previous messages
- **Values:** Check how aligned messages are with community-defined values.
- **Wildcard:** Transform messages into the voice of the most recent group to complete the Build a Community quest.

# Use of Grant Funds
**User Research and Evaluation:** User research is critical to our project's ongoing success and evolution. We aim to invite select communities to participate in the ""Build a Community"" game and conduct user interviews with players post-gameplay. This will allow us to collect valuable insights into user experiences, challenges, engagement levels, and changes in perspectives on decision-making. The result will be a report reviewing the bot's impact on users' understanding and approach to decentralized governance online and within their communities.

User research will be supported by Val Elefante who brings user research experience gained while in the context of the Metagov Gateway + PolicyKit project. Additionally, our advisor, Ellie Rennie, complements our research with her track record of ethnographic studies on online communities, particularly communities using Discord and web3 tooling/infrastructure.

# Budget
We would like to work with 3-5 communities for this report. Here is our budget breakdown:

- $1000 to conduct outreach, a playtest, user research, and a report of our interaction with a single community. 
- $500 to produce the final report 
- **Total Budget:** $3500-5500

# Timeline
Approximately 2-4 months, depending on the number of communities we conduct research with. 

# Team
d20 was incubated at Metagov by the following team: 

- Janita Chalam (Developer)
- Val Elefante (Researcher)
- Hazel (Researcher)
- Cent Hosten (Developer)
- Ellie Rennie (Advisor)

# Conclusion
By enabling communities to test elements of modular governance in a playful and interactive way, we believe d20 will significantly contribute to advancing both the experience and understanding of online self-governance. Your support will help us carry out this initiative and promote a fun, interactive environment to learn, educate, and experience alternative governance structures on the internet outside the prevailing paradigm of ""implicit feudalism"".

‚úèÔ∏è **Our Research**

The governance of most decentralized crypto organizations is based on the 1 token/1 vote model. In this type of governance, people with a lot of capital or influence have too much power over the community. 

This model is not only plutocratic, but also inefficient. As a few wallets monopolize influence over DAO decisions, they become able to use their treasury as they please: an existential risk for any decentralized organization. 

The use of this capital for their own interests can range from overpricing a proposal for provide a service to the DAO to attacking it in order to drain its treasury. 

In recent years, we've seen attacks on DAO governance with greater frequency. One example is RFV Raiders. 

Their aim is to buy governance tokens at a discount to the treasury. By acquiring them, the aim is not to invest in the project, but to force the DAO to close its doors and divide the treasury among its ******holders -****** with the RFV Raiders being the largest holders of the governance token.

Regardless of how governance is exploited, this is a risk that all DAOs run. 

You have to create ways to protect yourself from attacks like this. 

One of them is to create a metric to measure how exploitable DAOs are: and we've done that. 

We carried out a research paper this year to see how exploitable the biggest DAOs on the market are. To measure this, we created a metric called EXPLORABILITY.

**You can read the full research here**: 

https://docsend.com/view/asjkarybnq252ids
https://twitter.com/guiribabrb/status/1657712123730853889 (thread written by our analyst guiriba)

We found that there are organizations with millions of dollars in the treasury that are easily exploitable by wallets with lots of votes/tokens. 

Metrics such as explorability help DAOs to curb bad faith and identify flaws in their governance.

üí° **What we want**

Therefore, our aim is to expand this research to:

- Analyze more DAOs from different sectors.
- Complement it with more data to improve our metrics on the explorability of DAOs.
- Understand the impact of the delegation model on the governance of DAOs

We see this research as fundamental to contributing to the security of the billions of dollars stored in the treasure of DAOs across the ecosystem.

The rise of digital networks and blockchain technologies have catalyzed the formation of voluntary, network-based political communities aspiring to sovereignty beyond traditional territorial confines (see Network States, Coordi-Nations). Our research group is undertaking an investigation that aspires to uncover the nature, challenges, and transformative potential of these new political communities, poised to redefine the global political landscape.


## Why it matters

In a rapidly changing social, economic, and geopolitical context, where technology revolutionizes societal structures and existential risks demand enhanced global cooperation, understanding the (r)evolution of political sovereignty becomes crucial. The traditional state-centric model of sovereignty is witnessing the emergence of more fluid, participatory, network-based governance models bolstered by digital innovation. Understanding these new political communities is crucial for those who hope to navigate and shape this new political and economic era.

It is easy to create a multi-sensor array using sensors that take numerical measurements ‚Äì such as a chemical sensor array ‚Äì but when the data collected is encoded in natural language, there is no ready metric available for synthesizing multiple inputs without an attendant loss of meaning.

My intuition is that the solution to this problem is embedded in the problem, itself: the very same vector databases that enable large language models to interact with users in natural language can be understood as providing the framework needed to compare/synthesize natural-language data points with a minimal loss of meaning, insofar as they operate by projecting natural language into a complex system of mathematical representations thereof.

This intuition, however, does not reach the question of mechanism; hence, further research is required. Can an LLM ""do the math"" required for natural language sensor fusion ‚Äì and if so, what kind of prompting is required? Can an LLM's ""embeddings"" be abstracted from the model itself, and used as the basis for a natural language sensor fusion process that does not otherwise involve the ""source"" LLM? Since some measure of meaning must be lost in the process of making natural language computable, is it possible to identify where and how these losses are likeliest to take place, and to develop ways of mitigating them?

This work has important implications, specifically in the area of public opinion research, which has become less and less reliable as older ways of ""taking the temperature of the public"" have struggled to consistently provide accurate readings. Good governance requires good data, and good data depends on functional sensors. In some ways, the problem of natural language sensor fusion is the problem of democracy itself: How can disparate perspectives be synthesized into a clear signal, while respecting the messiness of the discourse from which that signal emerges?

In A Social History of Truth, Steven Shapin describes the original spirit behind peer review. Scientists needed ways to trust other scientists, and, even if rejecting all higher callings, for no other reason than to trust the materials and supplies they are buying to run their own, solitary experiments. Without an ability to trust in another‚Äôs work, every scientist would have to start the inquiry all over again. 

Modern peer review in its current form is one of the main processes for forming the graph of ‚Äúofficially sanctioned knowledge.‚Äù Thus, any flaws in this system have compounding effects on society and the ability of future researchers to publish their findings, especially when these findings run contrary to received wisdom in their field. 

While peer review remains an integral part of academic publishing, its flaws have become increasingly apparent. Fame can allow somebody to become an ‚Äúultra-reviewer,‚Äù while poorly positioned scientists running novel experiments are caught by the wayside. 

The grueling and long process of having a paper accepted in a journal is now known not just to academics, but to researchers in various professions who have learned how onerous and slow the process of attempting to publish their work in a ‚Äúreputable‚Äù journal often is, and to young people weighing how they want to spend their careers and to what they want to dedicate their talents. 

With new tools for decentralized work, I propose a ‚Äúpeer-to-peer review‚Äù research initiative. The goal of this initiative would be to develop a decentralized peer-review protocol that will solve or mitigate several existing problems with peer review: 

- Peer review can be an arbitrarily long process 
- Peer review as it exists today leads to elitism and cloistering effects
- Emerging fields, or multidisciplinary fields, often do not have ways of using existing peer review processes to garner legitimacy 
- Peer review often relies on volunteers
	
Potential research directions could include: 
- Assembling a network of interested researchers to run pilot experiments with
- Checking which blockchain-based incentive structures may encourage researchers in currently underrepresented groups to participate in reviewing others‚Äô work
- Creating a map of intellectual domains that are currently underserved in the credibility marketplace 
- Porting experiments in peer-to-peer ‚Äúrating‚Äù dynamics onto the problems in peer review
- Completing a functional analysis of peer review

A peer review system that is not fully trusted can quickly and unexpectedly lead to hard-to-model social problems. Research into alternative models and decentralized modes of peer review can therefore lead to considerable benefits for scientific coordination.

A conscious, decentralized, and autonomous venture capital system would allow for the democratization of start-up funding across Latin America, fostering wealth redistribution, social good and financial inclusion. These outcomes often fall by the wayside in traditional venture capital operations that primarily emphasize profit maximization and are accessible predominantly to the sophisticated and wealthy investors. 


Venture capital provides part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost to the general public by the substantial financial commitments, typically ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, required in traditional venture capital, and the high degree of sophistication necessary to discern projects that can be successful. 


We propose a solution that builds on principles of conscious capital and the benefits of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, we propose a hybrid model to ensure transparency and fair access to venture capital. This model takes the form of a decentralized autonomous organization, a virtual organization built and run on code and blockchain technology, which we will call the Conscious Venture Capital Decentralized Autonomous Organization (CVCDAO). 


The CVCDAO broadens stakeholder consideration, balancing profitability with social good, gender equity, and financial inclusion. Its governance structure incorporates honorary token holders, chosen for their significant contributions to Latin America's startup ecosystem. These industry experts will offer the necessary sophistication for project selection, safeguarding high standards. Furthermore, our platform will provide educational resources and discussion forums to help less sophisticated investors in its transformation and growth process to sophisticated investors.


The CVCDAO's investment token will be designed to counter economic barriers and be available to all individuals in Latin America, irrespective of their financial capacity. Considering that investing in startups is a risky venture, individuals who cannot afford to lose their investment will be discouraged to participate. Further we will promote financial inclusivity by enabling both small and large investors to participate in the startup ecosystem.

We will reinvigorate the network effect by fostering deep community engagement. As more entrepreneurs introduce ventures to the CVCDAO community, members evolve from simple participants to avid promoters, amplifying the venture¬¥s impact fostering authentic support based on shared values. This synergy of trust and success, coupled with the rapid pace of modern technology adoption will lead to exponential scalability. Within this framework, startup valuations derive not just from analytics but from genuine user involvement, setting a new paradigm in the entrepreneurial landscape.  


We aim to measure our impact as we will report annually on the number of start-ups funded, return on investment, and socio-economic improvements such as job creation, poverty reduction, gender equity and financial inclusion enhancements. These reports will be publicly accessible to foster transparency and accountability. 


This is a long-term vision, through this new model we aim to extend the benefits of venture capital to more people, potentially influencing the lives of over 662 million individuals that live in Latin America. Although we are sure that we will face many challenges along the way, mainly from the financial regulator, by expanding the reach of venture capital we will redraw the socio-economic landscape across Latin America, stimulate economic growth, and drive equitable advancement in the region.



1. Introduction


In the current venture capital ecosystem, access to startup funding is notably skewed towards the privileged minority who possess considerable financial resources and sophisticated knowledge of business practices. This leaves a significant proportion of the global population, particularly in regions like Latin America, sidelined in the world of entrepreneurial investment. On the other hand, traditional venture capital systems prioritize profit maximization, often overlooking broader societal impacts like wealth redistribution, social good, gender equity, and financial inclusion. The structure of such systems and the high entry barriers act as deterrents to potential investors who lack the financial means or the business acumen to participate confidently.


However, with the advent of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, a new opportunity has emerged to democratize access to venture capital funding. We introduce an innovative model ‚Äì the Conscious Venture Capital Decentralized Autonomous Organization (‚ÄúCVCDAO‚Äù) ‚Äì that leverages these cutting-edge technologies to break down the barriers to participation in venture capital. The CVCDAO aims to create a more inclusive and socially-conscious venture capital ecosystem, designed specifically to address the unique socio-economic landscape of Latin America.


The CVCDAO proposes a new paradigm in venture capital funding, allowing for wider participation while balancing profitability with broader social objectives. Our model acknowledges that wealth creation and social improvement are not mutually exclusive but can be synergistically achieved through conscious capital. It seeks to broaden stakeholder consideration, bringing financial inclusivity and gender equity to the fore while fostering social good. Furthermore, the CVCDAO takes a cautionary approach to risk management, discouraging participation from those who cannot afford to withstand potential financial losses, thus mitigating the risk of exacerbating financial inequality.


Despite the ambitious goals of the CVCDAO, it is important to note that this project will face significant challenges. Among these is gaining acceptance from financial regulators, who may view such a radical departure from traditional financial systems with skepticism. Nonetheless, we are confident that the CVCDAO holds great potential to drive economic growth, stimulate equitable advancement, and redraw the socio-economic landscape across Latin America.


In this paper, we explore the design and implementation of the CVCDAO, its potential impact on Latin American societies, and the challenges we anticipate facing along this transformative journey.



2. The Issues with Traditional Venture Capital


Venture capital has long been an engine of innovation and economic growth, providing the funding necessary for startups to pursue disruptive ideas and technologies. However, the traditional venture capital system is fraught with structural barriers and imbalances that often exclude a vast majority of the population, particularly in underprivileged regions like Latin America.


Firstly, venture capital tends to emphasize profit maximization, often at the expense of broader societal benefits. The focus on high-return investments tends to narrow the pool of funded startups to those promising rapid growth and substantial profitability. This profit-first approach often overlooks startups aiming to address social issues, promote gender equity, or contribute to financial inclusion, as these tend not to promise the high short-term returns that venture capitalists typically seek.


Secondly, access to venture capital funding is typically restricted to a privileged minority. Substantial financial commitments, often ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, are usually required, making venture capital inaccessible to the average individual or small business owner. Furthermore, the process of discerning which startups are likely to succeed requires a high degree of sophistication and knowledge, acting as another barrier to entry for the average investor, a barrier that we will try to overcome by training our token holder.


Lastly, the governance of traditional venture capital funds is usually centralized, with decision-making power concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy individuals or institutions. This structure can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, further exacerbating the issues of inclusivity and fair access.


The introduction of blockchain technology has provided a partial solution by offering a platform for transparent and secure transactions. Yet, even blockchain's potential is hampered by the substantial financial commitments and the level of sophistication required in the traditional venture capital system. These barriers keep the potential benefits of blockchain and venture capital out of reach for the general public.


In the following sections, we propose a model that leverages the principles of conscious capital, the transparency of blockchain technology, and the power of artificial intelligence to build a decentralized venture capital system that is accessible, transparent, and places equal importance on profitability and societal benefits. Our proposed model, the CVCDAO, aims to address these issues and bring the potential of venture capital to a broader audience.



3. The Blockchain Solution


The advent of blockchain technology has introduced transformative possibilities for numerous industries, and venture capital is no exception. Think of it like a shared digital ledger, much like a communal spreadsheet. Imagine a small coffee shop seeking investors. Using blockchain, each investment is recorded as a digital ""block."" When someone invests, their contribution is added to this ledger, and everyone can see it. It's like writing in a communal book where the entries, once written, cannot be changed or erased. This ensures trust and transparency among all involved. However, to fully leverage these possibilities, we need to overcome the limitations and address the complexities associated with its integration.


Blockchain's inherent characteristics of transparency, immutability, and security offer potential solutions to some of the structural problems of traditional venture capital. For instance, the transparency and traceability of transactions on a blockchain can improve accountability in the venture capital process. Investors can track their investments, follow their progress, and see exactly how funds are used.


Yet, while blockchain provides a platform for secure and transparent transactions, its benefits have largely been inaccessible to the general public. Substantial financial commitments, typically ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, are required to participate in traditional venture capital, and these barriers are often carried over into blockchain-based ventures. Furthermore, understanding and investing in FinTech and Blockchain projects require a high degree of sophistication, expertise, and knowledge about both the technology and the market, creating an additional barrier for non-expert investors.


Our solution leverages the transparency and security of blockchain technology, but it also addresses these accessibility issues. The CVCDAO builds upon the principles of conscious capital to create a venture capital system that is not only more transparent and secure but also more accessible to the broader public.


The CVCDAO utilizes blockchain technology in a distinctive manner, reshaping how venture capital investments are approached and administered. Anyone will be able to participate, since, in due course, the investment token may be purchased for as little as one dollar. This approach seeks to ensure affordability and widespread participation, furthering the democratization of venture capital.


Blockchain's capabilities are not limited to transparent transactions and secure record-keeping; its programmability allows for the implementation of smart contracts to automate various aspects of the venture capital process, ensuring fairness and further boosting transparency.


More specifically, blockchain allows for the creation of a distributed ledger that records all transactions in a tamper-proof manner. This is achieved through cryptographic hashing, a process that converts transaction data into a string of numbers and letters of a fixed length. If anyone attempts to alter a transaction, the cryptographic hash changes significantly, thereby signaling the alteration. 


In the next sections, we delve deeper into how we designed the CVCDAO, its features, and the strategies we implemented to address the challenges of traditional venture capital and optimize the use of blockchain technology. We also touch upon the potential challenges we might face, mainly from financial regulators, and how we intend to address them.



4. The Big Data solution


In today's digital era, data has become an incredibly valuable resource. It provides critical insights into market trends, consumer behavior, and industry patterns, among other things. However, harnessing this potential requires careful management and sophisticated analysis tools. This is where Big Data comes into play.


Big Data offers a powerful solution for managing and interpreting the vast amounts of data generated in our increasingly digital world. Yet, its application in venture capital has been limited, with many firms continuing to rely on traditional analysis methods or on surface-level data that do not provide a comprehensive picture of the investment landscape and few firms that use it to exploit it to benefit the small investor.


The integration of Big Data in our CVCDAO model aims to revolutionize this. By leveraging advanced analytics, we can sift through massive datasets to extract useful insights that can inform our investment strategies and decisions.


Big Data solutions can handle vast amounts of structured and unstructured data to reveal patterns and trends that can inform investment strategies. In the context of the CVCDAO, a Big Data approach could involve the collection and analysis of diverse datasets, including historical start-up success rates, market trends, and individual investor behavior. Powerful data analytics tools can process this data in real-time, providing valuable insights that aid decision-making and pricing strategies. 


In the context of the CVCDAO, Big Data will play a key role to obtain financial and market information regarding each of the projects to be financed in order to determine the viability and risk of the same. In addition and in relation to investors, Big Data will enable us to obtain formation related to their preferences, in order to analyze their entry into the CVCDAO. This will allow us to personalize the investment experience, tailoring the participation of individual investors and ensuring broader participation. In essence, Big Data allows us to make the venture capital landscape more accessible and affordable, further democratizing the process.


However, the effective use of Big Data also presents its own set of challenges. Among these are concerns related to data privacy, data quality, and the risk of bias in data-driven decision-making. To address these, we will implement rigorous data governance standards and adhere to local and international data protection laws. We will also use robust, tested algorithms to minimize the risk of bias in our analyses and will regularly review and update these algorithms to ensure their accuracy and fairness.


We also anticipate the need for significant computational resources and expertise to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of data. To this end, we will invest in high-capacity cloud storage solutions and recruit a team of data scientists and analysts with experience in venture capital and Big Data analytics.


In summary, the CVCDAO's Big Data solution will enable us to make more informed, data-driven decisions, optimize our pricing structure, and make venture capital more accessible. In the following sections, we will discuss in more detail how we plan to implement this Big Data strategy and integrate it with the CVCDAO's blockchain technology and principles of conscious capital.



5. The Artificial Intelligence Solution


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already begun to transform many sectors of our economy, from healthcare to logistics, yet its potential to disrupt the traditional venture capital model is not fully realized.


In the context of the CVCDAO, we envisage AI as an invaluable tool to complement the benefits of blockchain technology and Big Data. AI can enhance the decision-making process, enable personalized investor experiences, and ensure the efficiency and scalability of our system. Furthermore we can create a Large Language Model to explain CVCDAO in simple words in any language, working 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.


However, the use of AI is not without challenges. For instance, there are ethical considerations related to transparency and explainability of AI models, bias in AI decision-making, and data privacy. Moreover, the complexity of AI models may also introduce new risks, including the susceptibility to adversarial attacks or the difficulty of ensuring the model's robustness.


To mitigate these concerns, we commit to the principles of responsible AI, which include transparency, fairness, and accountability. We will ensure that our AI models are interpretable and their decisions can be explained. Bias audits will be conducted annually to ensure fairness in decision-making, and strong encryption and privacy-preserving techniques will be employed to protect investor data.


Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Machine Learning (ML), enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. AI/ML algorithms can find patterns in large datasets that humans might overlook, allowing for more accurate predictions. For CVCDAO, we would employ supervised learning algorithms that use labeled input-output pairs to make predictions about the financial, operational, legal, feasibility of a certain project to be financed, as well as the entry of new investors. Over time, as the AI receives more data, it refines its model, improving the accuracy of its predictions.


The deployment of AI in our venture capital model also requires building a robust AI infrastructure and cultivating AI talent. This includes investment in computational resources, model development and maintenance, and continuous training of our team to stay abreast with the latest developments in AI.


Despite these challenges, we believe that the benefits AI can bring to venture capital far outweigh its risks. By employing AI responsibly and transparently, we can democratize venture capital, making it accessible and affordable for a wider audience in Latin America.


In the subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into the specifics of our AI solution, the integration of AI with blockchain and Big Data, and how this combination will drive the operations of the CVCDAO.



6 The CVCDAO: A Hybrid Model


The CVCDAO is our proposed solution to the deficiencies of traditional venture capital models. Drawing upon the strengths of conscious capital principles, blockchain technology, Big Data, and artificial intelligence, we aim to build a venture capital system that is fair, inclusive, and efficient.


At its core, the CVCDAO prioritizes broad stakeholder consideration, balancing profitability with social good, gender equity, and financial inclusion. This represents a departure from traditional venture capital operations, which primarily emphasize profit maximization and are accessible predominantly to the sophisticated and wealthy. By doing so, the CVCDAO aligns with the principles of conscious capitalism, which assert that businesses should serve the interests of all major stakeholders‚Äîcustomers, employees, investors, communities, suppliers, and the environment.


The governance of the CVCDAO will be based on a decentralized model, made possible by blockchain technology. This entails that decisions within the organization are made collectively by its stakeholders, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment. To ensure that high standards are maintained in project selection, honorary token holders will be incorporated into the governance structure. These individuals, chosen for their significant contributions to the startup ecosystem in Latin America, will bring the necessary sophistication for discerning projects with potential for success.


The use of AI and Big Data within the CVCDAO sets it apart from other venture capital models. This ensures a more democratic access to venture capital, promoting both small and large investors' participation in the startup ecosystem.


However, the complexity inherent in this hybrid model presents its challenges. Ensuring transparency in the decision-making process, managing the vast amount of data, and integrating different technologies are nontrivial tasks. Moreover, the introduction of new technology can lead to new risks and vulnerabilities, such as those related to cybersecurity.


In response to these challenges, we commit to implementing robust systems, following best practices, and adhering to legal and ethical guidelines. To facilitate understanding of the CVCDAO, we will provide educational resources and a discussion forum for less sophisticated investors, furthering our commitment to inclusivity and transparency.


The CVCDAO represents a novel approach in venture capital, and it is certainly ambitious in its scope. As we further elaborate on its structure and operation, we acknowledge the need for iterative development, feedback, and adaptation. Despite the challenges, we believe that the CVCDAO can profoundly influence the democratization of venture capital in Latin America and beyond.



7. Governance and Decision Making


The governance of the CVCDAO relies on a dual structure that combines decentralized decision-making with the expert oversight of honorary token holders. Honorary token holders are chosen based on their significant contributions to Latin America's startup ecosystem. They bring their expertise and understanding to the table, guiding the venture capital decisions of the CVCDAO.


Criteria for selection of these experts include their track record in the Latin American startup ecosystem, their ability to contribute to the decision-making process, and their willingness to uphold the principles of conscious capital. These honorary token holders will have a tenure of two years, after which they can be re-elected based on their performance and contribution.


Honorary token holders will be entitled to vote on the projects to be funded and the strategic decisions of the organization. Each token corresponds to one vote, and decisions will typically require a simple majority. However, for critical strategic decisions, a two-thirds majority will be required. All voting will be conducted securely on the blockchain platform, ensuring transparency, auditability, and immutability of votes.


Potential conflicts of interest among the honorary token holders will be managed through a strict declaration process. Experts with a conflict of interest will be required to disclose it and will be barred from voting on related decisions.


The CVCDAO is committed to promoting harmony among its stakeholders. Therefore, in case of disagreements or disputes, a conflict resolution committee, comprising randomly selected token holders, will be formed to address the issue impartially.


In addition, we will create an educational program for non expert investors with the goal of providing them with the necessary knowledge to be able to access honorary tokens.  


Through this model of governance, the CVCDAO aims to blend expertise with inclusivity, bringing together diverse voices while ensuring informed decisions that are in line with its mission of fostering wealth redistribution, social good, gender equity, and financial inclusion across Latin America.



8. Token Pricing and Participation


Different from the government tokens, the pricing and participation of investment tokens, intended for the general public, are designed to embody financial inclusivity. This model ensures affordability and wide participation, promoting democratization in venture capital funding.


Our CVCDAO investment token will be available to all individuals in Latin America, and will be specifically designed to tackle economic disparities and promote inclusivity.


As venture capital investments inherently carry a risk of potential losses, we prioritize protecting those who cannot afford such losses. AI and machine learning will also be used to estimate an individual's risk tolerance based on their financial status and investment history. If the system determines that the potential loss would be too detrimental to an investor, they will be discouraged from investing. This cautionary measure is in line with our principle of conscious capital and our commitment to do no harm to our investors.


The pricing model ensures that both small and large investors can participate in the startup ecosystem, regardless of their financial capacity.


These measures demonstrate our commitment to fostering a broad-based and equitable venture capital system in Latin America. We aim to create a balanced ecosystem of small and large investors, facilitating a wide participation that stands to redraw the socio-economic landscape across the region.



9. Impact Assessment and Challenges


Our impact assessment strategy is focused on ensuring transparency and accountability. Annually, we will compile and release detailed reports on the number of start-ups funded, return on investment, and key socio-economic indicators. This includes improvements in job creation, poverty reduction, gender equity, and financial inclusion.


To ensure the accuracy of our impact reporting, we will employ independent auditors and evaluators. These third-party entities will verify the data we gather and the assessments we make, ensuring the credibility of our reported impact. The reports will be made publicly available on our website and will be disseminated through various channels, including social media and press releases, to ensure maximum accessibility.


We are optimistic about the potential of our model, we are mindful of the complexity and uncertainties associated with operating in the evolving field of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Specifically, we acknowledge the regulatory challenges that lie ahead. The blending of conscious capital, blockchain technology, AI, and a decentralized autonomous organization into a hybrid venture capital model is an innovation that existing regulations may not be equipped to handle as there are gray areas in many jurisdictions. Regulatory bodies have the dual mandate of fostering innovation while protecting consumers, and our commitment is to work closely with them to ensure our operations are in compliance with any current and future regulations.  


We are prepared to face challenges such as evolving regulatory landscapes, compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC), data privacy and investor protections regulations. To mitigate these challenges, we have a dedicated team of legal experts who are ranked by national and international agencies among the top 2% of lawyers in the world and have been named Mexico's most disruptive digital lawyers, who have generated synergies with the financial regulator, fostering discussion forums in relation to new projects based on Blockchain and new technologies in order to have a legal framework and clear interpretations that provide legal certainty to to entrepreneurs. We commit to ongoing engagement with financial regulators across Latin America, to comply with the requirements, conditions and limitations set forth in the applicable regulations in each of the CVCDAO's launching phases, advocating for favorable regulations while ensuring we remain within legal boundaries.


While our model seeks to democratize venture capital and stimulate socio-economic growth in Latin America, it's essential to acknowledge the potential challenges and criticisms. Blockchain, despite its promise, still faces hurdles related to scalability and interoperability, which might hinder the smooth operation of the CVCDAO. There's also a risk that market volatility could affect token prices, potentially impacting the affordability for lower-income participants. And while AI and Big Data provide robust tools for analysis and decisions-making, biases in data could lead to skewed predictions, and there are privacy concerns related to the collection and use of personal final data. Addressing these challenges will require continuous technological innovation, robust data governance, and thoughtful regulatory compliance. 


Furthermore, we recognize the technical and operational challenges that come with leveraging cutting-edge technology. These include ensuring the security of our blockchain platform, maintaining the integrity and privacy of investor data, and managing the complexities of AI and machine learning systems. To address these challenges, we will assemble a robust team of technical experts and will invest in continuous improvement of our technology and operations.


Another potential challenge is maintaining the delicate balance between profitability and social impact. To ensure the model's sustainability, we will implement a comprehensive impact assessment strategy that continuously monitors and evaluates our projects from both a financial and socio-economic perspective. This approach will help ensure that while our activities promote social good, they also make sound financial sense.


However, it is vital for potential investors to understand the inherent risks involved in investing in startups, and by extension, in the CVCDAO. While our model seeks to democratize venture capital and makes every effort to select promising start-ups, the reality remains that not all start-ups will succeed. In fact, some might fail, which could lead to the loss of part or all of the investment. Hence, it is crucial that individuals only invest what they can afford to lose. We aim to educate potential investors about these risks, and we strongly discourage individuals who cannot afford such losses from participating.


In acknowledging these challenges, we remain committed to our long-term vision: democratizing venture capital in Latin America, stimulating economic growth, and driving equitable advancement across the region. While the path is likely to be steep, our mission to make a transformative impact in Latin America drives us to face these hurdles head-on.


10. Conclusion


In conclusion, the Conscious Venture Capital Decentralized Autonomous Organization (CVCDAO), a reality by the incorporation of Paradox Ventures, seeks to innovate traditional venture capital models by fostering an environment of conscious capital, democratization, and financial inclusion. By integrating principles of conscious capital, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and big data into a single hybrid model, we aim to provide a feasible solution to the inherent issues in traditional venture capital.


Our governance model puts a high value on stakeholder engagement and maintains a balanced focus on profitability, social good, gender equity, and financial inclusion. With a token pricing model designed for inclusivity, we hope to break down the financial barriers that have long limited participation in venture capital. We intend to ensure transparency and accountability by implementing rigorous reporting mechanisms.


Yet, we recognize that the success of this endeavor relies on a multitude of factors, including the collaboration and support of investors, startup community, regulators, and the general public. We are prepared to face the challenges that lie ahead and remain committed to our vision of reshaping the socio-economic landscape across Latin America.


However, this vision is not without its hurdles. Technological, regulatory, and market-related challenges may pose obstacles to the implementation and scaling of the CVCDAO. It's crucial to engage in continuous dialogue with all stakeholders, including investors, startups, and regulatory bodies, to navigate these challenges effectively. Regulatory acceptance will be particularly critical, given the innovative nature of our venture. As we move forward, we will need to remain adaptable, learning from our experiences and iterating our model to ensure it remains inclusive, effective, and equitable.


By extending the benefits of venture capital to more people, we anticipate stimulating economic growth and driving equitable advancement in the region. We are excited about the prospect of potentially influencing the lives of the 662 million individuals that live in Latin America, reshaping the venture capital ecosystem, and contributing significantly to wealth redistribution and poverty reduction. Through the CVCDAO, we aspire to create a model that could inspire similar initiatives globally, heralding a new era of conscious, decentralized, and inclusive venture capital.

We have participated in the Meta Pool and the core Round, where we have coordinated  IRL events, we will be doing webinars and one more event in Mexico City, we created a newsletter, a Banner for our readers and an intro for those who visit us on YouTube, besides we were part of the media committee of Ethereum Mexico and we also support Meta Pool. You can find this report published in the Gitcoin forum since our transparency is the best letter of introduction. 

We have also been in charge of making introductory videos, CryptoReuMD which is our champion managed to sneak into the Citizen Rounds within the first 10 places, with the intention of continuing the process of governance and decentralization. 

We have also worked with wonderful projects such as International Media Nodes and the Onboarding events for Optimism, Web3 Beach and Gold Coast. 
To this day we are still creating, experimenting and evaluating the best way to continue growing and with your help, we will be able to do more for our community every day.

What are our plans now?

Our efforts will  focus on three concepts

1.- Allied Nations for Gitcoin: We have decided that together we are stronger, because sometimes efforts are easily mitigated when we do not have an echo of participation or even we can present similar and repetitive ideas, so the quality does not decrease but the audience and impact is blurred. For this reason we invited CryptoConexi√≥n and Kairos Research to collaborate on an innovative Gitcoin 19 campaign that will include several ways to drive engagement:
Activity on X with Post, Spaces and Threads.
Activity on YouTube, we will have Shill Spaces on our YouTube channel.

Initiatives:  

-Newsletter and webinars/YouTube videos talking about  Gitcoin Passport, Gitcoin Grant stack, Moloch Traps

-Blog post explaining concept on CryptoConexion and an episode on the podcast with all allied nations

-Activity on social media platforms including LinkedIn and Instagram

-All the process and activities will  be tracked within our Notion page: https://www.notion.so/bankless/Contenido-7dee065797cd432291e16b67fe31c192

[![Notion.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CKCH1dCk/Notion.png)](https://postimg.cc/SXsz1Svx)

2.- We want to participate in the creation of a decentralized frontend from the Bankless Nation page, which will be created with the funds raised in this initiative, a page for onboarding new users to understand what crypto is all about, with direct links to the GitCoin pages with content translated into Spanish, Push update in our channel, so that people do not have to enter the Gitcoin page and have notifications of the rounds directly in their Push app and wallet. The channel is already created so we will just keep updating. In the same way this page will allow Staking with Meta Pool, page that will be created with WordPress and stored in IPFS, page that will be a public good and its maintenance and hosting will be sponsored by Naci√≥n Bankless with the funds obtained during the round, we do not charge at all for this process and neither for the creation of the page, everything will be collected from Round 19.

3.- We want to create our own Gitcoin round for DAO in Spanish that wants to start tooling with the Grants Stack and as an experiment we want to implement it inside Nacion Bankless, so this is going to be great if we can create it. With the help of some of our friends and with the funds that we are achieving, maybe in the first rounds we are going to pay for Notion subscriptions or plane tickets, but that‚Äôs how everything starts. So part of the funds are going to be designated for our own protocol round. 

KPI:
-We will track activity with Hypercertz and NFT for like-minded communities, participating in our events, in order to monitor the impact and chain activity of our participation. With a minimum target of 50 Hypercertz across the entire proposal, among attendees, 

-We will evaluate our Push channel activity with active subscribers in relation to notifications. 

-We will publish the traffic obtained within the Bankless Nation page with a connection to the Wallet and the number of people who have Staked through the Meta Pool contract.

The first Gticoin Rounds are going to be just in between the 19-20 rounds. A report is going to be available before the 20¬∞ round starts. 

Strength in numbers

Open Web Academy is a community of builders and developers based  in Mexico and LATAM and working on NEAR Protocol and creating solutions with Blockchain Operating System (BOS). In the last six months we have collaborated with different DeFi protocols to create their decentralized interfaces on BOS, thus allowing a new entry channel for new users, greater protection by not depending on a central server to show interfaces to a user and greater permanence in the time when putting chain code.

## Why BOS?
The BOS widget represents a persistent and non-objectionable space over time by containing interface code stamped on the NEAR Protocol chain, allowing a new entry channel to swaps powered by 1inch

## B.O.S.
A BOS helps everyone learn, build, and grow using any blockchain. Here, developers and all kinds of creators can easily deploy their own dApps with on-chain frontend code. The main benefits are in terms of accessibility, security, and composability.

This new approach leverages the unique capabilities of NEAR's asynchronous runtime to enable not only censorship resistance, but also verification + audit-ability. Furthermore, data from various blockchains can live in reusable components, available for anyone to inspect.

For example, a team building on Ethereum can use the BOS to give access to users on Ethereum and others on NEAR. Give it a try at [bos.gg](https://bos.gg)

## Proposal
The Open Web Academy team is committed to developing a token swap component on the Blockchain Operating System powered by 1INCH, maintaining and updating the widget as well as constantly promoting it over an indefinite period of time so that its traffic of users is greater.
Specific activities:

* Debug code
* Incorporate 1INCH technology into BOS
* Incorporate screens to show swap information and other data from 1inch network
Learn about other swaps that we have developed and that are now part of the Blockchain Operating system

What: We aim to hold events that boost the onboarding of Venezuelans to the crypto ecosystem, taking a special emphasis on those who are starting their way; offering the necessary tools for Web3 and Ethereum to have a real utility adapted to their contexts.

On the other hand, we want to focus on the number of builders and developers in the country, with activities such as courses, hackhatons or bootcamps, where dozens of participants will learn from the basics to specialized topics such as solidity. 

Where: Inside and outside Venezuela. During DEVCON VI we had the opportunity to meet hundreds of Venezuelans who make a living in the technology industry who want to be an active part of the Ethereum Venezuela community. 

When: This community project aims to have a duration of one year.

How: We have defined 3 areas of action: 
Online community building and creation of educational materials. 
Face-to-face learning sessions and web3 onboarding to vulnerable communities. 
Promotion and education around the Ethereum ecosystem for technical profiles (developers and related). 

Why: During DEVCON VI we noticed that there is a need to take the Ethereum community beyond the capital region, currently there are many people around the country that thanks to digital media have access to this information and with the necessary support could build the future of web3 for Venezuela and the region. 

Our goal is to directly impact the lives of 500 people over a year of activities, however, the indirect impact this could bring to our community is incalculable. We hope to hold workshops, community gatherings, hackhatons and bootcamps.

We are pleased to announce that we have partnered with the Cryptocuriosas community in the launch and distribution of the 'Crypto Creatives' Coloring Book project in Venezuela, which provides an educational approach to early childhood crypto and blockchain education. We expect it to directly impact the education of the children of people in the crypto ecosystem, with the potential for scalability for community education. 

We also hope to have the opportunity to provide scholarships for key team members to participate in events such as ETH Latam and Devconnect, as well as other major ecosystem events. By promoting your participation in these events, we provide a way to recognize your value and effort for the growth of our community, and the visibility of Venezuelan talent in events with global reach. 

Your contribution will not only have a lasting impact by empowering this new generation of ecosystem leaders but will also foster a more inclusive and vibrant web3 community.

# Education and Social Impact

As part of our work we not only seek to include new payment methods for merchants but also to educate about the benefits of accepting payments with cryptocurrencies or how cryptocurrencies can represent an alternative to traditional finance. 

We have been running education campaigns for artisans in the Sacred Valley of Cusco, the land of the Incas, so that they can sell their products through cryptocurrencies while learning more about the Decentralized Finance ecosystem. 

To date we have impacted more than 25 artisans in the Pisac area who already know about crypto, DeFi and the benefits of this technology.

# Proposal

An identified problem is that commerce needs to receive payments in a stable way, it cannot be affected by the volatility of some cryptocurrencies. In that line we seek to receive payments in any cryptocurrency and deliver the final value in a stable cryptocurrency or the cryptocurrency that the merchant decides. 

For that we seek to perform the orchestration of payments with cryptocurrencies, we will seek to integrate the 1Inch API to be able to always make this exchange of volatile token to a stable cryptocurrency or between stable cryptocurrencies themselves. You can see a representation of our proposal here:

We are focusing on onboarding, education and networking in the web3 ecosystem.

Our journey started in January 2022 hosting IRL educational events in Lima, we managed to host more than 30 events with partner communities. We also believe education can change the way we live and the development of Latin countries.

*The problem we solve*

According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in Latin America the percentage of women in the technology sector is around 25%, lower than the world average of 30%. In terms of web 3 technologies, blockchain and decentralized networks, the participation of women is even lower, with estimates ranging from 5-10%.

There are several factors that contribute to the low participation of women in the technology sector in Latin America. These include the lack of networking spaces to meet people from the technological field, another reason is gender stereotypes and biases, and finally mentioning the lack of access to education and training opportunities.

For this reason, at Women Biz our mission is to connect more women to the technological ecosystem of the web3 by holding events to inspire, educate and encourage networking among women. We also connect them with more women by generating networking networks and looking for growth opportunities.

*Our numbers:*

+30 face-to-face events organized
+70 attendees per event.
+30 scholarships awarded for events.

*About Women Biz Workshops and Academy*

We aim to break down complex web3 concepts into simpler, more digestible pieces connecting these new concepts with the knowledge and experiences women already have, allowing them to see the potential and relevance of web3 technology in their own lives and fields of work.

We try to make it more accessible for anyone. Since we started, our strategy is to focus on the best web3 learning experience for those who don¬¥t know anything about cryptos, blockchain or emerging technologies. For that, we are launched our first coworking for women & our virtual school, where women can enjoy and have their better experiences in the web3 journey.

Our Academy consist in series of web3 courses with leaders who want to share their knowledge with latam women and make the onboarding, projects, travel experience more easily for everyone.

The workshops bring to the women an onboarding to this web3 world. We¬¥re introducing them to the DeFi, decentralized finance.

We have recently organized more than 2 workshops with one of our partners on how to invest in crypto and how to leave the fear of participating in safe investments.

All of this has been possible thanks to the support of our sponsors. Now many girls have been encouraged to invest from the minimum. And we want to continue organizing these types of activities, from how to use the 1inch wallet, how to make a bridge and how to make money with decentralized finance applications. 

With 1Inch we have a project to organize 2 workshops per month, to start reaching out to more women seeking financial freedom.
We want to explore this world of DeFi more and with your hand we can achieve it!

Join us in our mission to make web3 more accessible and empowering for all!
Thank you for your support to a peruvian community.

Mesoamerican Reef DAO (MesoReefDAO) is a Regenerative Coral Reef Science initiative that focuses on the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of DeSci (Decentralized Science) that seeks to scale coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR).
The Mesoamerican Reef is indeed the second-largest coral reef system in the world, spanning over 600 miles along the coasts of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras (Fig 1). It is an incredibly diverse and ecologically important ecosystem, providing habitat for thousands of species that support ecological goods and services.


![alt text](https://wwflac.awsassets.panda.org/img/new_mar_map_01_1_531910.png)

MesoReefDAO is working to establish partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and governments to support the implementation of sustainable fishing practices and the development of marine protected areas in the MAR. The DAO believes that engaging local communities in conservation efforts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the region (Fig 2).

Fig 2. MesoReefDAO General Framework.


**Mission** 
The MesoReef DAO aims to restore, protect, preserve, and conserve the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem, working towards the [United Nations Decade of Restoration framework](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/publications/ecosystem-restoration-playbook-practical-guide-healing-planet), through the implementation of regenerative practices, big data analytics, and decentralized technologies. We will foster a decentralized and collaborative management system to ensure a sustainable future for the reef and the people that depend on it.


**Vision**


The MesoReef DAO envisions a future where the Mesoamerican Reef ecosystem is thriving, providing ecological and economic benefits to local communities and visitors. We will achieve this by restoring degraded coral habitats, improving water quality, reducing pollution, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and educating local communities and visitors.


**Problem**


The problem that MesoReefDAO is trying to solve/mitigate is the rapid deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef System due to climate change, pollution, overfishing, biodiversity loss, and other human activities. The Mesoamerican Reef System is one of the most biodiverse and economically important coral reef systems in the world, providing critical habitat for numerous species of marine life and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region.


However, the reef system is under significant threat in the Anthropocene. The current approaches to address these issues have not been sufficient, with a lack of coordination between stakeholders, insufficient funding, and limited implementation of scientific research and data-driven decision-making.

Fig 3. Coral Outplanting areas in the Mexican Caribbean.


**How?**


MesoReefDAO aimed to mitigate the problems facing the Mesoamerican Reef through decentralized science web3 tools, community engagement, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As a DAO, MesoReefDAO is governed by its members, who collectively make decisions and allocate resources based on a set of rules and protocols encoded on the blockchain.


The framework model is centered around creating a decentralized, transparent, and sustainable system of funding and decision-making for regenerate coral reef conservation efforts in the Mesoamerican Reef System (Fig 4).

**In this proposal, we aim to further develop and expand the capabilities of MesoReefDAO through the Climate Solutions category of the Gitcoin Grants program.**


Our proposed project includes:

1. Explore and potentially build a user-friendly interface for MesoReefDAO: A well-designed interface will help to attract more users and make it easier for them to contribute to conservation efforts. The interface will also provide transparency into the decision-making process and the allocation of funds.


2. Developing a regenerative decentralized science (DeSci) offset program for the MAR: Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the MAR. To mitigate its impact, we plan to create a community-based decentralized science offset program that will incentivize individuals and organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to MAR conservation efforts. The program will be transparently managed through MesoReefDAO.


3. Partnering with coral reef scientists: We aim to collaborate with coral reef scientists to identify and prioritize conservation efforts based on scientific research. This will ensure that the funds raised through MesoReefDAO are used in the most effective and impactful way possible.


4. Implementing smart contracts: Smart contracts will be used to automate the distribution of funds and ensure transparency and accountability. This will eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce the risk of fraud and mismanagement.

L0 Bridge is a decentralized cross-chain bridge based on L0 cross-chain technology, offering low fees, high security, and high flexibility.

## Low Fees
When using L0 Bridge for cross-chain transactions, users only need to pay minimal L0 gas fees and very low bridge fees, currently set at one hundred thousandth of the bridge amount. For certain specific currencies, fixed bridge fees can also be set, meaning that the bridge fee remains the same regardless of the size of the cross-chain amount.

## High Security
L0 Bridge is built on L0 cross-chain technology, which has been running securely and stably for several years without major security vulnerabilities. 

The L0 Bridge contract design is straightforward and has undergone multiple rounds of auditing by experienced developers in the crypto community. We believe this makes it more reliable than audit reports from most other institutions.

## High Flexibility
L0 Bridge supports the interoperability of all cross-chain currencies on the supported blockchains. When liquidity is insufficient on one chain, users can safely redeem funds from another chain.

# Liquidity added
## User adds on-chain liquidity
Users can add liquidity to any chain to obtain LPToken (Liquidity Providers Token).

LPToken is a net-value token whose value increases with the increase in handling fees.
## Liquidity redeem
Liquidity added on a specific chain can only be withdrawn on that chain.

By default, LPToken can be redeemed and converted into real Token. If liquidity is insufficient, it can also be redeemed as CPToken. CPToken can be cross-chained to other chains, and then the real Token can be redeemd from other chains.

# Cross-chain
## Cross-chain Registration
Only DAO can register cross-chain currency mapping.
## Review
If the currency addresses on both chains are the same, the review process can be omitted. Otherwise, the correctness of the address needs to be verified. The review process may differ depending on whether the currency already exists on both chains, and may be more complex or simpler.
## No need to register to cross-chain
If the target chain does not register the currency, the user will receive Custom-CPToken. Custom-CPToken is an ordinary token that can be used for transfer transactions, but it cannot be exchanged for a real Token on the target chain, nor can it cross to a non-source chain, that is, it can only go back and forth from there.
## When liquidity is insufficient
After cross-chain, if the liquidity is insufficient, the user will receive CPToken and cannot redeem it until the liquidity is sufficient. This kind of CPToken is different from the Custom-CPToken obtained across chains when not registered. It can be cross-chained to any registered chain and then redeem the real Token from these chains.

# Cross-chain Fees
## The fee consists of two parts
L0 gas fee + bridge fee
## Bridge fee
Can be fixed or proportional
### Bridge fee currency
What is collected is cross-chain currency.
### Fixed bridge fee
The fixed bridge fee needs to be set by the DAO. If there is no fixed bridge fee set, it will be charged according to a fixed ratio, and the rate will be as low as MultiChain.
### Security of fixed fee setting
The fixed fee setting has a safety protection mechanism and cannot exceed the maximum proportionally calculated amount. For example, if the maximum ratio is 1%, you cannot set a fixed fee of more than 1%.
### Proportional rate of bridge fee
The proportional bridge fee rate is set by DAO. If a certain currency does not set a fixed bridge fee, the cross-chain bridge fee will be charged in proportion.
### Security of proportional rate settings
The maximum proportional rate can only be set to 1%
### Bridge fee must be charged
If it is found that the amount of cross-chains is too small and the bridge fee cannot be charged, at least an unit fee will be charged.

## L0 Gas fee
There is no way to optimize the L0 gas fee charged by L0. It is a fixed fee set by L0 at some time.
## Fee Donation
Support project parties or other big players to donate cross-chain fees.

The donation is divided into two parts, the bridge fee donation and the L0 gas fee donation. 

Once donated, it cannot be returned.
### L0 gas fee donation
L0 Gas fee donation is used to launch cross-chain chains. eg: L0 gas fees donated in the arbitrum chain can only be used in arbitrum cross-chain, using L0's own subsidy mode.
### Bridge fee donation
The bridge fee donation is used to target chains. eg: The bridge fee donated in the arbitrum chain can only be used when crossing the chain to arbitrum, and it can only be in the cross-chain currency.

# Income Distribution
## Liquidity Rewards
### Reward users
Add liquidity users
### Liquidity reward source
A certain proportion of cross-chain bridge fees, the proportion can be adjusted by DAO. Currently 60%

##Project Party Income
### Source of income
A certain proportion of cross-chain bridge fees, the proportion can be adjusted by DAO. Currently 25%

## DAO income
### Source of income
A certain proportion of cross-chain bridge fees. The proportion can be adjusted by DAO. Currently 15%.

# DAO
## Configurable parameters
Income distribution ratio, default bridge fee ratio, fixed bridge fee, currency register, withdrawal of all liquidity of ReBase deflation currency

# Special attention
## Beware of deflation and inflation currencies
Deflation and inflation currencies are not within the scope of L0 Bridge support, but they have no impact on L0 Bridge. The L0 Bridge contract will calculate the actual amount received.
## Be careful with ReBase currencies
ReBase currencies is not within the scope of L0 Bridge support. The excess of ReBase does not affect user use, that is, the liquidity recorded in the contract is less than the real balance, and DAO can withdraw the excess.

ReBase deflation will affect the use of users. At this time, users cannot perform remove operations because the deflation will immediately affect the interests of other users. The liquidity of this currency can only be proposed by DAO and handed over to DAO for subsequent processing.

Each transaction helps families with NO access to banking services in Latin America have financial inclusion, and achieve credit freedom.

# Abstract

People from under-developed countries pay extreme fees in loans year to year. This tighten them on an infinite credit turmoil.

# The Problem

Families in El Salvador have to pay up to 60% in fees for credits as small as $2,000 USD. Which means they have to work harder, and financial entities simply take advantage of their lack of knowledge in Decentralized Solutions and Non-Existent Financial Background. Banks keep consuming farmer‚Äôs wealth and vanish their dreams to achieve financial freedom.

In some cases, Shark-loan people end up using physical violence to collect payment from defaulting borrowers, which can even result in deaths.

# Solution

Enters Sochi: We are onboarding this families so they can have access to collateralized loans using their goods or any asset that can be backed-up on-chain under El Salvador‚Äôs Digital Asset law.

Sochi's revenue shared model removes the barriers to investors whiling to deposit their assets and those who really care about helping the unbanked in El Salvador with a high annual yield of more than 5% in Stables.

# Proposal / Details

We are a small team of buildors from El Salvador. We have been ideating Sochi since the May, 2023. Have a little demo done and need help to set a full-time solidity engineer to finish up and go live.

We'd love to have 2 engineers working full time in Sochi and go live before Q2 next year. An initial budget of $2,500/ engineer is be more than sufficient for us to allocate resources + cover costs like marketing in twitter, tiktok, NFT creation + airdrops and token launch.

Thanks a lot in advance. You don't know how happy we'll be to have at least the runway for one month to be fully dedicated on building Sochi.

# Rewards to early adopters

Just again, thanks everyone for helping Sochi become a real thing. We are having a fundraising project in Juicebox -> https://juicebox.money/@goradish, we're commit to disburse NFTs + token shares to project donors.

We can't promise anything, but if we hit our milestone of $30,000 we will ship a Sochi/Radish Hoodie to anyone, anywhere ü•≥ü•≥!

# Integrations

Our focus is to optimize yield having automated strategies on top of yield aggregators (Yearn, Harvest, Beefy and Idle)

## [Download Dev Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)

The goal of LunCo is to integrate Space & Robotics industry existing models into one Virtual World, allowing collaborative (concurrent) engineering.

While focused on Space Engineering, it's not limited to it. With Godot as a 3D engine, it's **easy to add new functions and models, e.g. plan Solar Power Station parameters,** and concept of operations, e.g. how often to clean panels.


The funds from this particular grant would be used to tokens modeling support in LunCo opening ways to model complex systems in scenarios like:
1. Solar panel produces energy, tokens are issued based on that
2. Tokens could be ussued for different activites, like collecting lunar dust
3. With that capability user would be able to model different effects of tokenomics in virtual world

Such a capability to model tokenomics in LunCo could be for interactive token engineering, and modeling complex systems up to a city scale, teaching TE in a fun and engaging way


The below diagram highlights the overall idea.

LunCo is focused on **Data Sovereignty**, meaning that there is no need for central server. Users can run it locally, use it to edit their project, and then share it with the community using IP-NFTs for data discoverability, and decentralized data exchange networks like IPFS to share data itself.

[![Multiuser](https://bafybeibdidgnutcuhqodxkvnh3qpecugyu6a7p6rvk7w36jwe5m4mtotty.ipfs.w3s.link/Federated.png)](https://twitter.com/LunCoSim/status/1679031437780201472)

## Why Web3?

Web3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. 

The most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.

## Impact

Through LunCo, we aim to:

- **Lower engineering costs,** by making knowledge sharing much more efficient
- **Democratize the engineering landscape**, providing equal access to manufacturing software for all
- **Foster a global engineering community** encouraging data and technology transfer across domains
- Serve as a **repository of high-quality data for engineering AI**

### What are your contributions to EarthistDAO in the past 6 months?

Rebioca aims to design the products of the future by recycling organic wastes with low carbon emissions, water use, and energy use. Rebioca is helping our planet with the organic waste process as we have been working with ‚Äúnature‚Äôs gift‚Äù black soldier flies. We process organic waste in a much green way and produce protein-rich end products such as fertilizer, BSF oil, and many more while reducing x0.4 carbon emissions per tonne compared to traditional methodologies. Effective management of organic waste presents several environmental and economic benefits. Additionally, converting organic waste into compost or biogas can provide renewable energy, enrich soil fertility, and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers. We are in a testing phase with EarthistDAO with the industrial hemp waste to create a circular economy between ReFi applications.

### What are my future plans of contribution?

After the testing phases and validated results, we aim to scale the solution to local farming areas which EarthistDAO has an organic connection with. We will continue to explore opportunities that include organic waste management, resulting in providing organic fertilizer and protein-rich animal feed, such as prototyping a mobile BSF organic waste trailer that can travel around different locations with limited capacity.",https://twitter.com/regenesturk,bafkreielffveabyxrrppxlauhl6soqem5p7ur3kizxidnbf2h5mr6sg6ay,bafkreihysmci6j3ff2macqwp33jhdh3znqkijzb354fqen5i46b5iyjmnq,emotemot,NA,regenesturk,bafkreiabnx6xss2aayfbfkczcagykkcumxfbt5wqyy7rkewwqywio6tfi4

In the past four years, my journey in the realm of hemp has been marked by creativity, collaboration, and a profound connection with individuals dedicated to conscious production and regeneration. Over the last six months, communication played a pivotal role in fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. 

Engaging closely with local artisans in Rize, we transformed raw hemp fibers into a diverse range of products, from yarns and textiles to handbags and hats. I was involved in every step of the process, from planning and designing to logistics. This experience provided me with a valuable opportunity to learn firsthand about the local manufacturing of hemp yarn and understand the traditional methods used in the past.

Participating in events like the Aromatherapy Fest as a member of Earthist became a celebration of harmony between nature and wellness. In preparation, we meticulously crafted our hemp-based skincare products, alongside other hemp items such as pet toys and rugs. Presenting our products elicited positive reactions from attendees, reinforcing our belief in the power of sustainable, nature-inspired solutions for everyday needs.

Collaboration took center stage as I organized workshops with fellow enthusiasts. Guided by experts like Ipek Caldemir, we explored the intricate balance of science and creativity in soap making with pure hemp seed oil. Another inspiring session led by Melodi and Stefan delved into the fascinating realm of biomimicry, where nature's wisdom inspired our approach to design and creation.

Amidst these experiences, I had the privilege of contributing to the design of the Earthist Hub‚Äîa space where creativity and innovation flourish. It became a vibrant environment where ideas flowed freely, fostering teamwork and empowering us to explore new horizons.

Future Plans for Contribution:

Reflecting on these past six months fills me with pride for our achievements and fuels my anticipation for the future. This journey, shaped by co-working, teamwork, and a shared vision, continues to inspire me. I am convinced that hemp can fulfill essential and special needs, and I am eager to witness this transformation happening. Moving forward, I am committed to furthering our efforts in sustainable practices, exploring innovative avenues, and fostering collaborations that will contribute to the widespread adoption of hemp-based solutions.

Thus, the protocol enables users to take undercollateralized borrows to increase their positions in vaults and/or yield farming strategies, resulting in higher returns for both active yield seekers as well as passive lenders. Rodeo is introducing a novel collateral system whereby users can stake their yield bearing assets and borrow (with leverage) for use in the Rodeo Farms, thus maintaining exposure to the underlying asset yield AND earning additional yields in the leverage farms.

- ACS develops and publishes screening guidelines
- Grants to health system partners help reduce barriers to cancer screenings

I tell people all the time, ""I get screened because I plan to have grandchildren, and I wanna be around for my kids and their kids.""‚Äã - James, prostate cancer survivor.

The American Cancer Society leads efforts across the nation to increase cancer screening rates because we know that finding cancer early increases survival rates. We develop and publish cancer screening guidelines to give people the best chance to survive a diagnosis.

Through donor and regional support, the American Cancer Society provided $1.5 million in grant funding in 2022 to 76 health system partners to bolster their efforts and further help reduce barriers to accessing cancer screening, resulting in 362,400 breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening completed.

Twelve US state coalitions or roundtables were funded to develop cancer awareness campaigns in 2022. We advocate at the federal and state level for protection for increased funding for breast and cervical cancer screening.

Our cancer screening public awareness campaign reaches millions of people each year, providing information and helping people find a screening location in their communities.
We fund health equity grants and screening programs to help reduce disparities in cancer care among communities of color. Our CHANGE grant program has contributed to more than 1.3 million low to no-cost breast, cervical or colorectal cancer screenings in local communities since 2011.

I tell people all the time, ""I get screened because I plan to have grandchildren, and I wanna be around for my kids and their kids.""‚Äã - James, prostate cancer survivor.

The American Cancer Society leads efforts across the nation to increase cancer screening rates because we know that finding cancer early increases survival rates. We develop and publish cancer screening guidelines to give people the best chance to survive a diagnosis.

Through donor and regional support, the American Cancer Society provided $1.5 million in grant funding in 2022 to 76 health system partners to bolster their efforts and further help reduce barriers to accessing cancer screening, resulting in 362,400 breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening completed.

Twelve US state coalitions or roundtables were funded to develop cancer awareness campaigns in 2022. We advocate at the federal and state level for protection for increased funding for breast and cervical cancer screening.

Our cancer screening public awareness campaign reaches millions of people each year, providing information and helping people find a screening location in their communities.
We fund health equity grants and screening programs to help reduce disparities in cancer care among communities of color. Our CHANGE grant program has contributed to more than 1.3 million low to no-cost breast, cervical or colorectal cancer screenings in local communities since 2011.
